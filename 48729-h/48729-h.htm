</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> <em>was</em> a curious thing, said
the private tutor; one of
those grotesque and whimsical
incidents which occur
to one as one goes through
life. I lost the best situation
which I am ever likely to have through it.
But I am glad that I went to Thorpe
Place, for I gained&mdash;well, as I tell you the
story you will learn what I gained.</p>

<p>I don't know whether you are familiar with
that part of the Midlands which is drained
by the Avon. It is the most English
part of England. Shakespeare, the flower
of the whole race, was born right in the
middle of it. It is a land of rolling pastures,
rising in higher folds to the westward, until
they swell into the Malvern Hills. There
are no towns, but numerous villages, each
with its grey Norman church. You have
left the brick of the southern and eastern
counties behind you, and everything is stone&mdash;stone
for the walls, and lichened slabs of
stone for the roofs. It is all grim and
solid and massive, as befits the heart of a
great nation.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of this country, not
very far from Evesham, that Sir John Bollamore
lived in the old ancestral home of
Thorpe Place, and thither it was that I came
to teach his two little sons. Sir John was
a widower&mdash;his wife had died three years
before&mdash;and he had been left with these two
lads aged eight and ten, and one dear little
girl of seven. Miss Witherton, who is now
my wife, was governess to this little girl. I
was tutor to the two boys. Could there be
a more obvious prelude to an engagement?
She governs me now, and I tutor two little
boys of our own. But, there&mdash;I have already
revealed what it was which I gained in
Thorpe Place!</p>

<p>It was a very, very old house, incredibly
old&mdash;pre-Norman, some of, it&mdash;and the
Bollamores claimed to have lived in that
situation since long before the Conquest. It
struck a chill to my heart when first I came
there, those enormously thick grey walls, the
rude crumbling stones, the smell as from a
sick animal which exhaled from the rotting
plaster of the aged building. But the modern
wing was bright and the garden was well
kept. No house could be dismal which had
a pretty girl inside it and such a show of
roses in front.</p>

<p>Apart from a very complete staff of servants
there were only four of us in the household.
These were Miss Witherton, who was at that
time four-and-twenty and as pretty&mdash;well, as
pretty as Mrs. Colmore is now&mdash;myself,
Frank Colmore, aged thirty, Mrs. Stevens,
the housekeeper, a dry, silent woman, and
Mr. Richards, a tall, military-looking man,
who acted as steward to the Bollamore
estates. We four always had our meals
together, but Sir John had his usually alone
in the library. Sometimes he joined us at
dinner, but on the whole we were just as glad
when he did not.</p>

<p>For he was a very formidable person.
Imagine a man six foot three inches in height,
majestically built, with a high-nosed, aristocratic
face, brindled hair, shaggy eyebrows, a
small, pointed Mephistophelian beard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
lines upon his brow and round his eyes as
deep as if they had been carved with a penknife.
He had grey eyes, weary, hopeless-looking
eyes, proud and yet pathetic, eyes
which claimed your pity and yet dared you
to show it. His back was rounded with
study, but otherwise he was as fine a looking
man of his age&mdash;five-and-fifty perhaps&mdash;as
any woman would wish to look upon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/image005.jpg" width="373" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SIR JOHN BOLLAMORE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But his presence was not a cheerful
one. He was always
courteous, always refined,
but singularly
silent and retiring.
I have never lived
so long with any
man and known so
little of him. If he
were indoors he
spent his time either
in his own small
study in the Eastern
Tower, or in the
library in the modern
wing. So regular
was his routine that
one could always say
at any hour exactly
where he would be.
Twice in the day he
would visit his study,
once after breakfast,
and once about ten
at night. You might
set your watch by
the slam of the heavy
door. For the rest
of the day he would
be in his library&mdash;save
that for an hour
or two in the afternoon
he would take
a walk or a ride,
which was solitary
like the rest of his
existence. He loved
his children, and was
keenly interested in
the progress of their studies, but they were
a little awed by the silent, shaggy-browed
figure, and they avoided him as much as they
could. Indeed, we all did that.</p>

<p>It was some time before I came to know
anything about the circumstances of Sir John
Bollamore's life, for Mrs. Stevens, the housekeeper,
and Mr. Richards, the land-steward,
were too loyal to talk easily of their employer's
affairs. As to the governess, she knew no
more than I did, and our common interest
was one of the causes which drew us together.
At last, however, an incident occurred which
led to a closer acquaintance with Mr. Richards
and a fuller knowledge of the life of the man
whom I served.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of this was no less
than the falling of Master Percy, the youngest
of my pupils, into the mill-race, with imminent
danger both to his life and to mine, since I
had to risk myself in order to save him.
Dripping and exhausted&mdash;for
I was
far more spent than
the child&mdash;I was
making for my room
when Sir John, who
had heard the hubbub,
opened the door
of his little study
and asked me what
was the matter. I
told him of the accident,
but assured
him that his child
was in no danger,
while he listened with
a rugged, immobile
face, which expressed
in its intense
eyes and tightened
lips all the emotion
which he tried to
conceal.</p>

<p>"One moment!
Step in here! Let
me have the details!"
said he, turning back
through the open
door.</p>

<p>And so I found
myself within that
little sanctum, inside
which, as I afterwards
learned, no
other foot had for
three years been set
save that of the old
servant who cleaned
it out. It was a round room, conforming
to the shape of the tower in which it
was situated, with a low ceiling, a single
narrow, ivy-wreathed window, and the simplest
of furniture. An old carpet, a single chair,
a deal table, and a small shelf of books made
up the whole contents. On the table stood
a full-length photograph of a woman&mdash;I took
no particular notice of the features, but I
remember that a certain gracious gentleness
was the prevailing impression. Beside it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
a large black japanned box and one or two
bundles of letters or papers fastened together
with elastic bands.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/image006.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"OUR INTERVIEW WAS A SHORT ONE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our interview was a short one, for Sir
John Bollamore perceived that I was soaked,
and that I should change without delay.
The incident led, however, to an instructive
talk with Richards, the agent, who had never
penetrated into the chamber which chance
had opened to me. That very afternoon he
came to me, all curiosity, and walked up and
down the garden path with me, while my two
charges played tennis upon the lawn beside
us.</p>

<p>"You hardly realize the exception which
has been made in your favour," said he.
"That room has been kept such a mystery,
and Sir John's visits to it have been so
regular and consistent, that an almost
superstitious feeling has arisen about it in the
household. I assure you that if I were to
repeat to you the tales which are flying about,
tales of mysterious visitors there, and of
voices overheard by the servants, you
might suspect that Sir John had relapsed
into his old ways."</p>

<p>"Why do you say relapsed?"
I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said he,
"that Sir John Bollamore's
previous history is unknown
to you?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"You astound me. I
thought that every man in
England knew something of
his antecedents. I should
not mention the matter if it
were not that you are now
one of ourselves, and that
the facts might come to
your ears in some harsher
form if I were silent upon
them. I always took it for
granted that you knew that
you were in the service of
'Devil' Bollamore."</p>

<p>"But why 'Devil'?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are young and
the world moves fast, but
twenty years ago the name
of 'Devil' Bollamore was
one of the best known in
London. He was the leader
of the fastest set, bruiser,
driver, gambler, drunkard&mdash;a
survival of the old type, and
as bad as the worst of them."</p>

<p>I stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, "that
quiet, studious, sad-faced
man?"</p>

<p>"The greatest rip and debauchee in
England! All between ourselves, Colmore.
But you understand now what I mean when
I say that a woman's voice in his room might
even now give rise to suspicions."</p>

<p>"But what can have changed him so?"</p>

<p>"Little Beryl Clare, when she took the
risk of becoming his wife. That was the
turning point. He had got so far that his
own fast set had thrown him over. There is
a world of difference, you know, between a
man who drinks and a drunkard. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
drink, but they taboo a drunkard. He had
become a slave to it&mdash;hopeless and helpless.
Then she stepped in, saw the
possibilities of a fine man in the wreck,
took her chance in marrying him, though
she might have had the pick of a dozen,
and, by devoting her life to it, brought him
back to manhood and decency. You have
observed that no liquor is ever kept in the
house. There never has been any since her
foot crossed its threshold. A drop of it
would be like blood to a tiger even now."</p>

<p>"Then her influence still holds him?"</p>

<p>"That is the wonder of it. When she
died three years ago, we all expected and
feared that he would fall back into his old
ways. She feared it herself, and the thought
gave a terror to death, for she was like a
guardian angel to that man, and lived only
for the one purpose. By the way, did you
see a black japanned box in his room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I fancy it contains her letters. If ever
he has occasion to be away, if only for a
single night, he invariably takes his black
japanned box with him. Well, well, Colmore,
perhaps I have told you rather more than I
should, but I shall expect you to reciprocate
if anything of interest should come to your
knowledge." I could see that the worthy
man was consumed with curiosity and just a
little piqued that I, the new-comer, should
have been the first to penetrate into the
untrodden chamber. But the fact raised me
in his esteem, and from that time onwards I
found myself upon more confidential terms
with him.</p>

<p>And now the silent and majestic figure of
my employer became an object of greater
interest to me. I began to understand that
strangely human look in his eyes, those deep
lines upon his careworn face. He was a
man who was fighting a ceaseless battle,
holding at arm's length, from morning till
night, a horrible adversary, who was for ever
trying to close with him&mdash;an adversary which
would destroy him body and soul could it
but fix its claws once more upon him. As
I watched the grim, round-backed figure
pacing the corridor or walking in the garden,
this imminent danger seemed to take bodily
shape, and I could almost fancy that I saw
this most loathsome and dangerous of all
the fiends crouching closely in his very
shadow, like a half-cowed beast which slinks
beside its keeper, ready at any unguarded
moment to spring at his throat. And the
dead woman, the woman who had spent her
life in warding off this danger, took shape
also to my imagination, and I saw her as a
shadowy but beautiful presence which intervened
for ever with arms uplifted to screen
the man whom she loved.</p>

<p>In some subtle way he divined the sympathy
which I had for him, and he showed
in his own silent fashion that he appreciated
it. He even invited me once to share his
afternoon walk, and although no word passed
between us on this occasion, it was a mark of
confidence which he had never shown to anyone
before. He asked me also to index his
library (it was one of the best private libraries
in England), and I spent many hours in the
evening in his presence, if not in his society,
he reading at his desk and I sitting in a
recess by the window reducing to order the
chaos which existed among his books. In
spite of these closer relations I was never
again asked to enter the chamber in the
turret.</p>

<p>And then came my revulsion of feeling.
A single incident changed all my sympathy
to loathing, and made me realize that my
employer still remained all that he had ever
been, with the additional vice of hypocrisy.
What happened was as follows.</p>

<p>One evening Miss Witherton had gone
down to Broadway, the neighbouring village,
to sing at a concert for some charity, and I,
according to my promise, had walked over to
escort her back. The drive sweeps round
under the eastern turret, and I observed as I
passed that the light was lit in the circular
room. It was a summer evening, and the
window, which was a little higher than our
heads, was open. We were, as it happened,
engrossed in our own conversation at the
moment, and we had paused upon the lawn
which skirts the old turret, when suddenly
something broke in upon our talk and turned
our thoughts away from our own affairs.</p>

<p>It was a voice&mdash;the voice undoubtedly of
a woman. It was low&mdash;so low that it was
only in that still night air that we could have
heard it, but, hushed as it was, there was no
mistaking its feminine timbre. It spoke
hurriedly, gaspingly for a few sentences, and
then was silent&mdash;a piteous, breathless, imploring
sort of voice. Miss Witherton and I
stood for an instant staring at each other.
Then we walked quickly in the direction of
the hall-door.</p>

<p>"It came through the window," I said.</p>

<p>"We must not play the part of eaves-droppers,"
she answered. "We must forget
that we have ever heard it."</p>

<p>There was an absence of surprise in her
manner which suggested a new idea to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have heard it before," I cried.</p>

<p>"I could not help it. My own room is
higher up on the same turret. It has
happened frequently."</p>

<p>"Who can the woman be?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea. I had rather not discuss
it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/image008.jpg" width="410" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IT WAS THE VOICE UNDOUBTEDLY OF A WOMAN."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Her voice was enough to show me what
she thought. But granting that our employer
led a double and dubious life, who could she
be, this mysterious woman who kept him
company in the old tower? I knew from
my own inspection how bleak and bare a
room it was. She certainly did not live
there. But in that case where did she come
from? It could not be any one of the household.
They were all under the vigilant eyes
of Mrs. Stevens. The visitor must come
from without. But how?</p>

<p>And then suddenly I remembered how
ancient this building was, and how probable
that some medi&aelig;val passage existed in it.
There is hardly an old castle without one.
The mysterious room was the basement of
the turret, so that if there were anything of
the sort it would open through the floor.
There were numerous cottages in the immediate
vicinity. The other end of the secret
passage might lie among some tangle of
bramble in the neighbouring copse. I said
nothing to anyone, but I felt that the secret
of my employer lay within my power.</p>

<p>And the more convinced I was of this the
more I marvelled at the manner in which
he concealed his true nature. Often as
I watched his austere
figure, I asked myself if
it were indeed possible
that such a man should
be living this double life,
and I tried to persuade
myself that my suspicions
might after all prove to
be ill-founded. But there
was the female voice,
there was the secret
nightly rendezvous in the
turret chamber&mdash;how
could such facts admit
of an innocent interpretation?
I conceived a
horror of the man. I
was filled with loathing
at his deep, consistent
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Only once during all
those months did I ever
see him without that sad
but impassive mask
which he usually presented
towards his fellow-man.
For an instant I
caught a glimpse of those
volcanic fires which he
had damped down so
long. The occasion was
an unworthy one, for the
object of his wrath was
none other than the aged charwoman whom
I have already mentioned as being the one
person who was allowed within his mysterious
chamber. I was passing the corridor
which led to the turret&mdash;for my own room
lay in that direction&mdash;when I heard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
sudden, startled scream, and merged in
it the husky, growling note of a man
who is inarticulate with passion. It was
the snarl of a furious wild beast. Then
I heard his voice thrilling with anger. "You
would dare!" he cried. "You would dare
to disobey my directions!" An instant later
the charwoman passed me, flying down the
passage, white faced and tremulous, while
the terrible voice thundered behind her.
"Go to Mrs. Stevens for your money!
Never set foot in Thorpe Place again!"
Consumed with curiosity, I could not help
following the woman, and found her round
the corner leaning against the wall and palpitating
like a frightened rabbit.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/image009.jpg" width="467" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"NEVER SET FOOT IN THORPE PLACE AGAIN!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Brown?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It's master!" she gasped. "Oh 'ow 'e
frightened me! If you 'ad seen 'is eyes,
Mr. Colmore, sir. I thought 'e would 'ave
been the death of me."</p>

<p>"But what had you done?"</p>

<p>"Done, sir! Nothing. At least nothing to
make so much of. Just laid my 'and on that
black box of 'is&mdash;'adn't even opened it, when
in 'e came and you 'eard the way 'e went
on. I've lost my place, and glad I am
of it, for I would never trust myself within
reach of 'im again."</p>

<p>So it was the japanned
box which was the cause
of this outburst&mdash;the box
from which he would never
permit himself to be separated.
What was the connection,
or was there any
connection between this and
the secret visits of the lady
whose voice I had overheard?
Sir John Bollamore's
wrath was enduring as well
as fiery, for from that day
Mrs. Brown, the charwoman,
vanished from our ken, and
Thorpe Place knew her no
more.</p>

<p>And now I wish to tell
you the singular chance
which solved all these
strange questions and put
my employer's secret in my
possession. The story may
leave you with some lingering
doubt as to whether
my curiosity did not get the
better of my honour, and
whether I did not condescend
to play the spy. If
you choose to think so I
cannot help it, but can only
assure you that, improbable
as it may appear, the matter
came about exactly as I
describe it.</p>

<p>The first stage in this
<em>d&eacute;nouement</em> was that the
small room on the turret
became uninhabitable. This
occurred through the fall of
the worm-eaten oaken beam
which supported the ceiling. Rotten with
age, it snapped in the middle one morning,
and brought down a quantity of the
plaster with it. Fortunately Sir John was
not in the room at the time. His precious
box was rescued from amongst the <em>d&eacute;bris</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and brought into the library, where, henceforward,
it was locked within his bureau. Sir
John took no steps to repair the damage, and
I never had an opportunity of searching for
that secret passage, the existence of which I
had surmised. As to the lady, I had thought
that this would have brought her visits to
an end, had I not one evening heard Mr.
Richards asking Mrs. Stevens who the woman
was whom he had overheard talking to Sir
John in the library. I could not catch her
reply, but I saw from her manner that it
was not the first time that she had had to
answer or avoid the same question.</p>

<p>"You've heard the voice, Colmore?"
said the agent.</p>

<p>I confessed that I had.</p>

<p>"And what do <em>you</em> think of it?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders, and remarked
that it was no business of mine.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you are just as curious as
any of us. Is it a woman or not?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly a woman."</p>

<p>"Which room did you hear
it from?"</p>

<p>"From the turret-room, before
the ceiling fell."</p>

<p>"But I heard it from the
library only last night. I passed
the door as I was going to bed, and
I heard something wailing and
praying just as plainly as I hear
you. It may be a woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, what else <em>could</em> it be?"</p>

<p>He looked at me hard.</p>

<p>"There are more things in
heaven and earth," said he. "If
it is a woman, how does she get
there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"No, nor I. But if it is the
other thing&mdash;but there, for a
practical business man at the
end of the nineteenth century
this is rather a ridiculous line of
conversation." He turned away,
but I saw that he felt even more
than he had said. To all the
old ghost stories of Thorpe Place
a new one was being added
before our very eyes. It may
by this time have taken its permanent
place, for though an
explanation came to me, it never
reached the others.</p>

<p>And my explanation came in
this way. I had suffered a
sleepless night from neuralgia,
and about mid-day I had taken
a heavy dose of chlorodyne to alleviate the
pain. At that time I was finishing the indexing
of Sir John Bollamore's library, and it
was my custom to work there from five till
seven. On this particular day I struggled
against the double effect of my bad night and
the narcotic. I have already mentioned
that there was a recess in the library, and
in this it was my habit to work. I settled
down steadily to my task, but my weariness
overcame me and, falling back upon the
settee, I dropped into a heavy sleep.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/image010.jpg" width="460" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SIR JOHN BOLLAMORE WAS SITTING AT HIS STUDY TABLE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>How long I slept I do not know, but it
was quite dark when I awoke. Confused
by the chlorodyne which I had taken, I lay
motionless in a semi-conscious state. The
great room with its high walls covered with
books loomed darkly all round me. A dim
radiance from the moonlight came through
the farther window, and against this lighter
background I saw that Sir John Bollamore
was sitting at his study table. His well-set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
head and clearly cut profile were sharply outlined
against the glimmering square behind
him. He bent as I watched him, and I
heard the sharp turning of a key and the
rasping of metal upon metal. As if in a
dream I was vaguely conscious that this was
the japanned box which stood in front
of him, and that he had drawn something
out of it, something squat and
uncouth, which now lay before him upon
the table. I never realized&mdash;it never
occurred to my bemuddled and torpid brain
that I was intruding upon his privacy, that he
imagined himself to be alone in the room.
And then, just as it rushed upon my horrified
perceptions, and I had half risen to announce
my presence, I heard a strange, crisp, metallic
clicking, and then the voice.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a woman's voice; there could
not be a doubt of it. But a voice so charged
with entreaty and with yearning love, that it
will ring for ever in my ears. It came with a
curious far-away tinkle, but every word was
clear, though faint&mdash;very faint, for they were
the last words of a dying woman.</p>

<p>"I am not really gone, John," said the thin,
gasping voice. "I am here at your very
elbow, and shall be until we meet once more.
I die happy to think that morning and night
you will hear my voice. Oh, John, be strong,
be strong, until we meet again."</p>

<p>I say that I had risen in order to announce
my presence, but I could not do so while the
voice was sounding. I could only remain
half lying, half sitting, paralyzed, astounded,
listening to those yearning distant musical
words. And he&mdash;he was so absorbed that
even if I had spoken he might not have heard
me. But with the silence of the voice came
my half articulated apologies and explanations.
He sprang across the room, switched on the
electric light, and in its white glare I saw
him, his eyes gleaming with anger, his face
twisted with passion, as the hapless charwoman
may have seen him weeks before.</p>

<p>"Mr. Colmore!" he cried. "You here!
What is the meaning of this, sir?"</p>

<p>With halting words I explained it all, my
neuralgia, the narcotic, my luckless sleep and
singular awakening. As he listened the glow
of anger faded from his face, and the sad, impassive
mask closed once more over his
features.</p>

<p>"My secret is yours, Mr. Colmore," said
he. "I have only myself to blame for relaxing
my precautions. Half confidences are
worse than no confidences, and so you may
know all since you know so much. The
story may go where you will when I have
passed away, but until then I rely upon your
sense of honour that no human soul shall
hear it from your lips. I am proud still&mdash;God
help me!&mdash;or, at least, I am proud
enough to resent that pity which this story
would draw upon me. I have smiled at
envy, and disregarded hatred, but pity is
more than I can tolerate.</p>

<p>"You have heard the source from which the
voice comes&mdash;that voice which has, as I
understand, excited so much curiosity in my
household. I am aware of the rumours to
which it has given rise. These speculations,
whether scandalous or superstitious, are such
as I can disregard and forgive. What I
should never forgive would be a disloyal
spying and eavesdropping in order to satisfy
an illicit curiosity. But of that, Mr. Colmore,
I acquit you.</p>

<p>"When I was a young man, sir, many years
younger than you are now, I was launched
upon town without a friend or adviser,
and with a purse which brought only too
many false friends and false advisers to my
side. I drank deeply of the wine of life&mdash;if
there is a man living who has drunk more
deeply he is not a man whom I envy. My
purse suffered, my character suffered, my
constitution suffered, stimulants became a
necessity to me, I was a creature from whom
my memory recoils. And it was at that time,
the time of my blackest degradation, that
God sent into my life the gentlest, sweetest
spirit that ever descended as a ministering
angel from above. She loved me, broken as
I was, loved me, and spent her life in making
a man once more of that which had degraded
itself to the level of the beasts.</p>

<p>"But a fell disease struck her, and she
withered away before my eyes. In the hour
of her agony it was never of herself, of her
own sufferings and her own death, that she
thought. It was all of me. The one pang
which her fate brought to her was the fear
that when her influence was removed I should
revert to that which I had been. It was in
vain that I made oath to her that no drop of
wine would ever cross my lips. She knew
only too well the hold that the devil had
upon me&mdash;she who had striven so to loosen
it&mdash;and it haunted her night and day the
thought that my soul might again be within
his grip.</p>

<p>"It was from some friend's gossip of the
sick room that she heard of this invention&mdash;this
phonograph&mdash;and with the quick insight
of a loving woman she saw how she might
use it for her ends. She sent me to London
to procure the best which money could buy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
When I returned she lay actually in the
throes of death. And with her last breath&mdash;the
very last that she breathed upon
earth&mdash;she whispered this message into it,
a message to strengthen my resolves and to
retain her influence upon my actions. Into
her ear I whispered that twice a day for ever
afterwards I should listen to her dear voice,
and so, smiling at the success of her plan,
she passed gently away.</p>

<p>"So now you have my secret, Mr. Colmore,
and you understand why this japanned box
and that which it contains is more to me
than all my ancestral home. I trust you,
and I believe you to be worthy of my trust.
But after this the sight of you would be
painful to me, and so good-bye! You will
find no cause to regret having left my service,
but you will understand that we must never
meet again."</p>

<p>So this was the last time that I was ever
destined to see Sir John Bollamore, and I
left him standing in his library, with his
hand upon the instrument which brought
him that ever-recurring, intangible, and yet
intimate reminder from the woman whom
he loved. You may have read about his
death in a carriage accident last Midsummer.
I do not fancy that it was a very unwelcome
event to him.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span> an observant student of the
world's genius it is a reflection,
not without a peculiar interest
of its own, that the Australian
Continent has so far produced
but one woman-singer of the
first rank. Of poets whose genius is as undoubted
as their place in the world's literature
is certain Australia has given us at least two,
in Henry Kendall and the gifted but ill-fated
Adam Lindsay Gordon. To the drama this,
the "least contiguous" of the four continents,
has contributed Haddon Chambers&mdash;though
the creator of "Captain Swift" and "The
Idler" has now dwelt among us so long
as to be regarded as a fully naturalized
"Englander." The department of imaginative
literature is already represented by
quite a little army from "down under," as
the eminent names of Mrs. Campbell Praed,
"Tasma," Mr. Rolf Boldrewood, Miss Ada
Cambridge, Miss Ethel Turner, Mr. Guy
Boothby, and the late Marcus Clarke bear
eloquent testimony; whilst the field of critical
and biographical writing finds a worthy representative
in Mr. Patchett Martin.</p>

<p>But Melba stands alone. Towering head
and shoulders over every other aspirant to
the highest honours of grand opera, the
retirement of Madame Patti from the operatic
field has left "the Australian Nightingale"
undisputed ruler of an empire probably the
proudest in the sum of this planet's most
desirable possessions. Yet these are honours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
becomingly and graciously worn by one who,
scarcely a decade ago, was little more than a
name to the patrons and supporters of the
opera.</p>

<p>As I sit in her <em>salon</em> to-day, and chat with
this queenly woman, whose greatest charm
assuredly lies in her consideration for others,
I wonder whether she ever recalls that little
white-robed girl (herself) who, in far-off Melbourne,
in the dead of night, startled her
parents and brought them downstairs by her
playing of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."
It is a pretty story, with a prettier sequel.
For&nbsp;the parents of that little girl had not
the heart to chide
their offspring for
her "precocity"
(that unmeaning
word in which the
beginnings&nbsp;of
genius are so often
concealed),&nbsp;but
rather did they
coax her back to
bed as they marvelled
over what
they had heard.
Surely they must,
at that early
day, have had
some faint glimmering
of the
future in store for
the coming <i lang="it">prima
donna</i>!</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MADAME MELBA BEFORE HER D&Eacute;BUT, 1887.
<cite>From a Photo. by Chalot, Paris.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Perhaps they
did&mdash;I do not
know,"&nbsp;says
Madame Melba,
dreamily. "But
one thing I know
for certain&mdash;that
their daughter did
not cherish any
such aspirations
for a long time to
come. I went
quietly on with my education&mdash;no, not
my musical education, that came later&mdash;until
my marriage, which took place at
the early age of seventeen. Stop, though!
I&nbsp;was entirely forgetting to tell you the
story of what I call 'my first appearance
on any stage.' It took place at
the Town Hall, Richmond, which is a
suburb of Melbourne, and I was aged <em>six</em> at
the time! What did I sing? Let me see,
now! Yes, I sang 'Shells of the Ocean'
first, followed by 'Comin' thro' the Rye.' It
was a great occasion, as you may imagine,
and I am by no means certain that I am not
prouder of it than of anything I have done
since."</p>

<p>On the question as to whence&mdash;if traceable
at all&mdash;Madame Melba derives her voice and
natural musical gifts, she told me that her
mother was an accomplished musician. In
addition to being a beautiful pianist, she
played also the organ and the harp. Thus
it was that the future <i lang="it">prima donna</i> was reared
so to speak in the lap of Music. Her mother
was her first teacher of the piano, and afterwards
her studies were aided by the exertions
of her aunts Alice
and Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Even as a
child of three or
four," she continued,
"I was so
passionately devoted
to music
that I remember
frequently crawling
under the piano
and remaining
quiet there for
hours while listening
to my mother's
playing. Yes, my
mother sang also,
though she had
not a particularly
notable voice. But
her sister, my
'Aunt Lizzie,' as
I called her, possessed
a soprano
voice of extraordinary
beauty
and quality. To
this day I can
remember my
aunt's absolute
control of her
voice, and the
beauty and ease
of her execution even in the highest
<em>pianissimo</em> passages. Indeed, I feel sure
my Aunt Lizzie would have enjoyed a
brilliant career as a public singer, had she
adopted it."</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the <em>diva's</em>
father, Mr. David Mitchell, is a squatter
resident in the Colony of Victoria, and that
his several stations are far removed from
important townships. The family now reside
at Colbin Abbin Estate; but in the days
when Melba was a child they lived at "Steel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Flat," another of her father's estates, where
she was born and brought up, with intermittent
visits to Melbourne.</p>

<p>I was interested to find that the subject of
this interview can also trace the gift of music
on the paternal side of the house. To this
day her father sings in the local choir, and
his daughter told me she well remembered
his voice as a deep basso of beautiful
<em>timbre</em>. He has always been passionately
fond of music, and is, in addition to his
vocal talent (to quote his daughter's own
expression), "a fiddler of no mean ability."
Madame Melba speaks in the most affectionate
terms of both her parents. Her mother
died while the great singer was in her teens,
but Melba cherishes many sweet recollections
of her.</p>

<p>"She was a natural artist&mdash;not as regards
music only, for one remembers it in the
general expression of her life. She was,
among other things, a charming painter on
china, and the dessert-service still in use
at home was decorated by her brush.</p>

<p>"Did my father also foster my love of
music? Yes, indeed he did, to the utmost
of his power. When I was quite a baby it
was my great joy, on Sunday afternoons, to
sit on my father's knee at the harmonium.
He would blow the bellows with his feet,
while singing a bass accompaniment to the
hymn which I would pick out on the key-board
with one finger."</p>

<p>Thus, finding that the Australian singer
inherits the gift of song from either side of
her family, I inquired whether this passion
for music did not begin to take shape at a
very tender age.</p>

<p>"In illustration that that was so," she
answered, "I remember once our family
moving into 'winter quarters' at one of my
father's outlying stations. I was ten years
old at the time, but I know I felt
furious, on arrival, to find that there was
no piano in the house. My gentle mother
consoled me with the gift of <em>a concertina</em>,
which I taught myself to play during
the three months that we remained there!
In those sequestered places, in the case
of country houses very far removed from
a church or chapel, it is customary for a
clergyman or lay preacher to come along
on Sundays and preach to the family, the
servants, and station hands&mdash;often quite a
large congregation, particularly at shearing-time.</p>

<p>"One Sunday&mdash;I was then, perhaps,
thirteen years old&mdash;we were visited by a
worthy man, who chanced to be a particularly
poor preacher. At the conclusion
of his very long and (as we children
thought) somewhat wearisome discourse, he
suggested that we should sing a hymn.
There was a harmonium in the room, and
my mother asked me to play a familiar hymn.
I accordingly seated myself, but, in revenge
for having been so bored, I played&mdash;to the
horror of some and the secret delight of
others&mdash;a music-hall ditty which had succeeded
in penetrating our wilderness! It
was called, 'You Should See Me Dance the
Polka.' In the sequel, I received the well-merited
punishment of being sent to bed for
the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>"It must have been about the end of the
same year that I had, what I thought at the
time, a very fearsome adventure indeed! It
happened at Melbourne. I was learning to
play the organ, and I had permission occasionally
to practise on the great organ in the
Scots Church. Late one afternoon I ceased
playing, and fell into a reverie. When, at
last, I proceeded to leave the church, I
found, to my horror, I was locked in!
My playing having ceased for some time, the
sexton had concluded I was gone, and had
locked up the church and left. You cannot
conceive the agony of mind I endured. The
church was very dark, and the pulpit and
altar in their grey dust-cloths looked, to
my frightened imagination, like monstrous
ghosts. What should I do?... At last
the sexton returned&mdash;by the merest chance
he had forgotten something, which he came
back to fetch, and so I obtained my release."</p>

<p>About two years after her marriage,
namely, at the age of nineteen, Melba began
concert singing. At first she sang as an
amateur; but so rapidly did she betray
talents of an extraordinarily high order, that
she was strongly recommended to adopt the
vocal art as a profession. Upon this advice
she acted, and came to England to study.
The rest is history.</p>

<p>It is, however, history of an exceedingly
interesting character. It will be seen that,
in shaping her public career, Madame Melba
unconsciously moved in cycles of two years.
Thus, she was married at seventeen. At
nineteen she commenced to sing publicly.
At twenty-one she came to Europe in order
to study the art she had elected to follow.
At twenty-three occurred her <em>d&eacute;but</em> on the
operatic stage.</p>

<p>So far as operatic England is concerned,
the distinction of introducing Melba to the
Covent Garden public belongs to the late
Sir Augustus Harris, who subsequently wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a rather remarkable
letter on the subject
of the Australian
<em>d&eacute;butante's</em> quickly
won popularity.
Madame Melba's
initial appearance
on the Covent
Garden stage took
place in May, 1888,
as the ill-fated
heroine of Donizetti's
"Lucia di
Lammermoor." Her
success, both with
the critics and with
the public, was so
spontaneous and
overwhelming, that
her engagement for
the next (1889)
London season was
rendered inevitable.
The new <i lang="it">prima
donna's</i> principal
appearance of 1889
was in Gounod's
"Rom&eacute;o et Juliette,"
while her performance
in Verdi's
"Rigoletto" exhibited
how rapidly,
to quote Mr. Parker's
"Opera Under
Augustus Harris,"
"Madame Melba's
popularity was increasing
in this
country." In 1890 she created at Covent Garden
the character of <em>Ophelia</em> in Dr. Ambroise
Thomas's "Hamlet," which she had the advantage
of rehearsing with the composer himself.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MADAME MELBA IN "LAKM&Eacute;," 1890.

</div>

<p>In 1893 Melba went to America, to meet
with a wholly unprecedented success; but in
'94 she was back at Covent Garden, to charm
huge audiences with her <em>Nedda</em> in Leoncavallo's
"Pagliacci" and her <em>Marguerite</em> in
"Faust." Since then the cantatrice has
appeared with regularity during the London
opera season. Two of her most interesting
appearances have been in "Carmen" three
years ago, when that opera was performed
with the extraordinarily strong cast of Madame
Calv&eacute; as <em>Carmen</em>, Madame Melba as <em>Michaela</em>,
and M. Alvarez as <em>Don Jos&eacute;</em>; and in "Les
Huguenot&#347;" in 1896, when Albani was the
<em>Valentina</em>, and Melba the <em>Margherita de Valois</em>.
In that season, by the way, a gloom was cast
over English musical life by the deaths of
Sir Joseph Barnby
and Sir Augustus
Harris, the latter
being a personal
friend of Madame
Melba, and of whom
she cherishes many
pleasant recollections.</p>

</div>

<p>But then, as I told
the Australian <i lang="it">prima
donna</i>, in her case
"pleasant recollections"
must of necessity
multiply themselves,
by virtue of
the numbers of the
world's great ones
with whom her art
and her remarkable
gifts have brought
her in contact. And
yet she remains so
wholly and entirely a
"womanly woman,"
that I verily believe
she values the esteem
and admiration of the
lowliest peasant as
highly as that of the
great ones of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect of the personal friendships to
which I have just made reference, the <em>diva</em>
has delightful remembrances of masters like
the veteran Verdi, Charles Gounod (with
whom she had the privilege of rehearsing
his "Faust" and "Rom&eacute;o et Juliette"), poor
Goring Thomas, the creator of "Esmeralda,"
Tosti, and Puccini. In the case of the
latter composer, she studied her part in his
"La Boh&egrave;me" (a new assumption) with him
in Southern Italy last summer; and, if all
that we hear be true, she is destined to win
fresh laurels in the same composer's newest
work, "La Tosca," in which Puccini does for
Sardou's tragic story what Verdi has done
for Shakespeare's "Othello."</p>

<p>Nellie Melba is a woman of rare enthusiasms.
In conversation with me, she could
not say too much in praise of Madame
Matilde Marchesi&mdash;the only singing-teacher
she has ever had&mdash;and whom she speaks of
in terms of warmest affection and sympathy.</p>

<p>I asked the <i lang="it">prima donna</i> whether she has
ever experienced the excitement and danger
of a theatre fire. "Yes, on two occasions,"
she told me; "in San Francisco and in
London. In both cases the danger was
happily averted. At Covent Garden the
outbreak happened actually on the stage
during a performance of 'Faust,' and the
curtain had to be rung down. I chanced
to be in the 'wings' at the time, and while
they were battling with the flames behind
the curtain, I came in front and begged
the people to remain seated. Fortunately
that most terrible of calamities, a theatre
panic, was averted. As soon as I found
myself behind the scenes once more I committed
the weakness of fainting."</p>

<p>There have been, not unnaturally, some
striking incidents connected with Melba's
enormous popularity at the Paris Opera
House. There is one of them, however, to
which a pathetic interest attaches by reason
of the comparatively recent death of Madame
Carnot, who figured in it in very sympathetic
fashion. The opera was "Lucia di Lammermoor"&mdash;one
of Melba's greatest, if not her
very greatest assumption. It happened
that the tenor, Monsieur Cossira, arrived
at the Opera House feeling very unwell, but
apparently recovering before the opera began
he decided to go on. Early in the first act,
however, he almost completely lost his voice!
When it came to the duet with <em>Lucia</em> in the
first act, it utterly failed him. The <i lang="it">prima
donna</i>, full of sympathy for his difficulty, for a
time sang his music as well as her own; but
ultimately the curtain had to be rung down,
and for a few moments it appeared as though
the performance could not proceed, since&mdash;surely
a thing unprecedented at the Paris
Opera House&mdash;Monsieur Cossira was not
provided with an understudy! As luck
would have it, though, among the audience
was M. Engel, who had sung the part with
Melba, not long before, in Brussels. Grasping
the situation, he went behind the scenes
and proffered his services, which were gladly
and gratefully accepted. The performance
proceeded, and for several nights thereafter
M. Engel sang the part.</p>

<p>"At the close of the evening," added
Madame Melba, in telling me of the incident,
"Madame Carnot sent for me. It was during
Monsieur Carnot's reign at the Elys&eacute;e, and
so his wife was occupying the Presidential box
at the Opera. Being a woman of very quick
perception, Madame Carnot had observed my
efforts at covering the confusion of my poor
colleague. I can never forget her kind words
to me then, nor shall I readily forget the
sorrow I felt afterwards on hearing the news
of President Carnot's terrible end, and of
her own death subsequently."</p>

<p>By the time this interview appears in print,
Madame Melba will be in the thick of her
fifth visit to the United States. Her previous
operatic tours of the American Continent
have been full of varied and interesting
experiences. One of the most characteristic
"Melba stories" that I know dates from her
last tour but one. It was at St. Louis, where,
thanks to a late train, the <em>diva</em> and her
company arrived only a very little time before
the hour fixed for the commencement. There
was, in fact, only just time for the artists to
make for their respective dressing-rooms.
But Melba, looking down from a coign of
vantage into the orchestra, observed, to her
dismay and annoyance, that her musicians
were in morning dress. She promptly sent
for the <i lang="fr">chef d'orchestre</i>. The poor man
expostulated, remonstrated; they had but a
few minutes before come off the cars; there
was no time, etc. But Melba was firm. "If
the gentlemen of my orchestra do not choose
to appear in evening dress, I shall refuse to
go on the stage. I owe a duty to the public
as well as to myself."</p>

<p>This inexorable mandate had its effect,
and the musicians were soon seen filing out
of the orchestra, to return a few minutes
later, suitably clad in the evening garb of
comparative civilization. Then the curtain
rose and the opera commenced&mdash;only a very
little behind time. The incident did not,
however, pass unrecognised. The critics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Press had seen the musicians disappear
and re-appear, and correctly surmising the
cause of their "quick change," the result
was a series of graceful little
articles in the St. Louis papers
complimenting the popular favourite
upon her sense of the
fitness of things.</p>

</div>

<p>An incident without precedent
on the concert stage marked the
concert which Melba gave
at the Albert Hall, on November 2nd,
to signalize her departure for her present
trans-Atlantic tour. Of the three principal
performers&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, Madame Melba herself, Miss
Ada Crossley, the contralto, and Mr. Johann
Kruse, the solo violinist&mdash;all were not only
Australians, but Victorians by birth.</p>

</div>

<p>Immediately after her few but brilliant
appearances at Covent Garden last season,
Madame Melba rented a charmingly-situated
house, called "Fernley," near the river at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Maidenhead. Here she entertained many
friends during the month of August. A
very interesting "group" photograph of
three distinguished Australians&mdash;Melba, Mr.
Haddon Chambers, and Mr. Bertram
MacKennal&mdash;taken at that time on the lawn
at Fernley, is shown at the top of this page.
It will be interesting to your readers that
the last-named distinguished compatriot of
Madame Melba's is executing a bust of the
<em>diva</em>, which she has decided to present to
the Public Library of Melbourne. A bust of
the Melbourne Melba, by the Melbourne
MacKennal, is obviously an artistic event of
peculiar interest.</p>

</div>

<p>By the way, the popular morning "daily"
that unwittingly represented Melba as an
athletic kind of lady, skilled in the gentle art
of rowing, was sadly in error! Far and
away the most interesting episode of the stay
at Fernley was a visit which the <i lang="it">prima donna</i>
and some members of her house-party paid
to the grave of the poet Gray in Stoke Poges
churchyard. Here, it will be remembered,
Gray wrote his beautiful "Elegy"; and here,
too, Melba (who, I omitted to say, is an
accomplished organist, and often used to
play that instrument in the Scots Church at
Melbourne) expressed a desire to try the
organ in the charming old church of Stoke
Poges.</p>

<p>Thereby hangs this tale: The rector, on
it being represented to him that "Madame
Melba would like to play the organ," court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>eously
handed over the necessary keys, and
Melba gave great pleasure to her audience
of half-a-dozen friends by playing and singing
for them a selection of pieces, which included
the Gounod "Ave Maria," and ended
with the National Anthem. Asked by one
of the party how she had enjoyed the
impromptu sacred concert, the old lady
who was in charge of the church, and whose
services had been requisitioned to blow the
organ, enthusiastically rejoined, "Oh, it
were all beautiful, m'm, but 'God Save the
Queen' were best of all!"</p>

<p>Madame Melba is fortunate in having
some one member of her family&mdash;a brother
or sister, generally speaking&mdash;to accompany
her on her travels. During her last American
tour she had for companions both a sister
and a brother&mdash;Miss Dora and Mr. Ernest
Mitchell&mdash;and she still speaks of the regret
with which she parted from them when they
were obliged to return to their Antipodean
home about the end of the last London season.
She says she is not less fortunate in having a
man like Mr. Charles A. Ellis (originally
the business manager of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra) to personally conduct her
trans-Atlantic tours. The present one will be
very much extended, and will involve the
traversing of many thousands of miles by
the <em>diva</em> and her company. The principal
members of that company are Ternina, Z&eacute;lie
de Lussan, and Gadski, Alvarez, Bonnard,
Pandolfini, Kraus, and Bonderesque, and the
orchestra is controlled by Signor Seppilli and
Mr. Walter Damrosch. As for Melba's r&eacute;pertoire,
it comprises not only two <em>r&ocirc;les</em> quite new
to her&mdash;"Martha" and "La Boh&egrave;me"&mdash;but
also "Lucia," "Hamlet," "Manon," "Les
Huguenots," "La Traviata," "Rigoletto,"
"Faust," "Rom&eacute;o et Juliette," and "Il Barbi&egrave;re
di Siviglia"&mdash;in the last-named of which
she scored such a shining success at Covent
Garden last season. While on the subject of
America, I may mention that Madame Melba
seriously meditates refusing an offer for a
season in South America, which I take to be
the most dazzling and tempting ever made
to a <i lang="it">prima donna</i>. She whimsically says
that she thinks she would rather spend the
greater part of 1899 in Europe, although
she looks forward with pleasure to a visit
to South America later on.</p>

<p>I am reminded of one more "Melba
anecdote." Two or three years ago she
took a party of friends to see the interior
of La Scala, the noble opera-house where
many of her triumphs have been won.
Throwing open the door of a dressing-room,
their cicerone exclaimed, "This is
where the celebrated Melba used to dress!"
The great singer's friends began to laugh,
but she, looking hard at the man, quietly
asked him, "What! don't you know me?"
And then this son of Italy perceived that,
<em>sans</em> voice and <em>sans</em> diamonds though she
might be, she still was "Melba."</p>

<p>It is, I think, illustrative of Madame
Melba's large humanity that the simpler and
more sympathetic the anecdote, the better is
she pleased to tell it. For example, "one
touch of nature" is to her much more than
to tell of her many meetings with Royalty&mdash;of
her brilliant career as queen of opera&mdash;of
her impressions of the many great ones of
the world into whose society she has been
thrown. Of her <em>d&eacute;but</em> in opera she readily
speaks, for must it not always rank as one of
her pleasantest memories? It occurred at
the Brussels Opera House, and at the age of
twenty-two. Not at that time knowing French,
Melba was permitted to sing in Italian, while
the other artists sang French&mdash;an unprecedented
concession to a <em>d&eacute;butante</em> on the
part of the local opera authorities. On that
memorable evening, the next box to the one
occupied by some friends and relatives
of Madame Melba contained a lady and
gentleman. At the close of the first act,
the latter asked his companion as to her
opinion of the <em>d&eacute;butante</em>, when the lady
was heard to reply, "<em>D&eacute;butante!</em> Nonsense!
I heard her in Madrid ten years
ago. She was an awful failure, and <em>she's
forty if she's a day</em>!"</p>

<p>"Did you feel any resentment when you
heard the story?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," replied Madame Melba,
laughing merrily, "albeit in those early days
I had not grown accustomed, as, alas! I
have since, to hearing strangely false reports
about myself&mdash;reports sometimes amazing,
sometimes absurd, and sometimes, I fear,
malicious. Besides, I was in far too good a
humour with the public success I had
achieved to feel angry; and if the story
appears in your article, and the lady sees it,
I shall feel amply avenged."</p>

<p>Two incidents in connection with her first
American tour were related to me so feelingly
by the <i lang="it">prima donna</i>, that I must do my
best to reproduce them. The first occurred
in New York. Melba had been practising
her part at her hotel one afternoon. Just
as she had finished, and was coming out
of her rooms, she encountered a strange
lady, whose rooms opened into the same
corridor. The unknown approached her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and said, "Madame, I think you would be
touched to hear what my little boy said just
now. He is lying in bed getting over an
illness; and when you began to sing he
lifted his tiny forefinger and whispered,
'Hist, mummy! Birdie!'"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption"><p>MADAME MELBA (PRESENT DAY).
<cite>From a Photo. by Reutlinger, Paris.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>The second incident referred to occurred
one snowy night as the <em>diva</em> was leaving the
stage-door of the Opera House at Philadelphia.
An old lady, very neatly attired,
but evidently not in affluent circumstances,
was waiting for her as she crossed the foot-way
to her carriage. When Madame Melba
appeared the old lady remarked, "Madame,
I have just heard you sing, and I've waited
here in the hope that you will let me take
your hand." Melba, deeply touched, impulsively
kissed the old lady on either
cheek. This salutation won from its
recipient these simple words, which Melba
says she will never forget, "God bless your
beautiful heart, my dear!"</p>

<p>My interesting visit to Madame Melba
terminated with, on my part, a very natural
regret. I carried away with me an indelible impression&mdash;the
impression of a queenly woman,
an incomparable artist, bearing her unrivalled
gifts and her regal position in the world of
music with a simplicity and a womanly
modesty which, while unable to enhance their
value, add a singular grace and charm to
their possession. And I found it a pleasing
reflection that I had been accorded an
audience of a queen who is delightfully
unconscious of her sovereignty, and who,
even if robbed of the gifts which now enchant
the world, would still retain those qualities
which enchant her friends&mdash;her bright intelligence,
her ever-ready sympathies, and her
true womanliness.</p>

<h2><a name="His_Home_Coming" id="His_Home_Coming">His Home Coming</a></h2>

<p>BY E. M. JAMESON.</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a_alt.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"Another</span> present, Honor?
I thought you had really
received the last."</p>

<p>"So did I," replied Honor,
sitting up in her low chair,
and beginning to untie the
string that was round the small parcel.
"People are very kind; wonderfully
kind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latimer looked up quickly at the
sound of the dejected voice. She was a
slight, sweet-looking woman, in widow's
dress, whose face, despite its never-varying
sadness, bore traces of great beauty. The
present proved to be a very beautiful pendant
of emeralds and diamonds. Mrs. Latimer,
having admired it as it lay on its satin bed,
handed it back to her daughter.</p>

<p>"So kind of your Uncle James," she said,
as she did so, watching meantime, with
puzzled uneasiness, Honor's listless fingering
of the jewel-case.</p>

<p>"Very kind!" remarked the girl, tilting
her chin somewhat superciliously. "Am I
not marrying a rich man? If Ronald had
been poor, how would Uncle James have
treated me?"</p>

<p>"Honor, Honor," said her mother, a pained
look crossing her face, "how very unlike you
to be so bitter."</p>

<p>Honor crossed over to where her mother
sat and dropped down on the rug beside her,
and taking one of her mother's hands pressed
it to her cheek.</p>

<p>"He thinks it really, little mother, only you
are too good to see it, and know too that I
love Ronald so dearly that I'd marry him if
he hadn't a second coat to put on. Uncle
James, of all people!"&mdash;she threw the case
into the chair she had just vacated, her blue
eyes shining and hard&mdash;"Uncle James, who
might have done so much, who might have
saved his nephew from destruction by holding
out a helping hand. Poor Jim!"</p>

<p>Her clear voice broke for a moment, then
she pointed to a table in the corner that was
covered with wedding presents.</p>

<p>"I'd give them all for one little note from
Jim saying he was sorry and was coming to
us. Just imagine if he came home and sat
with us here in this very room! I cannot
get him out of my thoughts to-night. Perhaps,
somewhere, he is thinking of us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Latimer sank back in her chair, the
tears coursing down her face.</p>

<p>"I pray night and morning that he may
come back to us, and it seems as though
God turned a deaf ear to all my pleadings.
I dream of him, Honor, so often, our handsome
boy, as he was before he went astray,
and the awakening seems more than I can
bear."</p>

<p>A pang shot through Honor's heart as she
looked up into the fragile face, and she
regretted having been carried away to speak
of the prodigal.</p>

<p>"He will come back to us sooner or later,"
she said, hastily; "I am certain of it. He is
too fond of us to go far astray. The threats
Uncle James used terrified him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am almost sorry we left the other
house," Mrs. Latimer said, presently.
"Suppose he came and found strangers
occupying our place?"</p>

<p>"He has only to ask in the neighbourhood
to find us no farther than the next road,"
said Honor. "Don't let that worry you. He
will come home to us some day."</p>

<p>She spoke with a cheerfulness she was far
from experiencing; the thought had often
occurred to her that Jim, her only brother,
must be dead. Heedless and headstrong he
might be, but he had always possessed a
warm heart, and would not have left them
to anxiety for so long. Twice her wedding
had been postponed, but the prodigal still
delayed, and in a few days her marriage
would be an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Latimer said "good-night"
and went to bed. After lighting her candle
and watching her up the staircase, Honor
returned to the room
in which they had
spent the evening.
An unbearable restlessness
was upon her,
and she could settle
to nothing, though
there were notes to
be written and a host
of other things to be
done.</p>

<p>She heard the servants
troop up to bed,
and then a silence fell
upon the house, only
broken by the melancholy
soughing of the
wind among the trees
in the garden. The
loneliness and silence
told after a time, and
she rose to follow
her mother's example,
though sleep was the
farthest thing from her
thoughts. She examined
the window fastenings,
and picking up
the case containing the
pendant, placed it
among the presents
on the table. The
thought occurred to
her that there ought
to be a place in which to lock up the
valuables, but in her preoccupation the
fact troubled her little. Jim was the one
absorbing thought, ousting even Ronald
from her mind. A mental picture of Jim,
destitute and starving, rose before her continually,
embittering her life, and she could
look forward to nothing until she was at rest
about him.</p>

<p>She looked in at her mother on the way to
her own room, and found her sleeping tranquilly.
At the sight of the thin cheek on
the pillow, Honor's heart contracted painfully;
her mother grew paler and more
fragile day by day, and the doctors had said
that in the weak state of her heart a sudden
shock might prove fatal. A tear dropped on
the thin hand lying outside the counterpane,
and Honor crept away to her own room.
When ready for bed she lay in the
darkness, feeling every nerve acutely on
the alert.</p>

<p>The clock in the hall below ticked
solemnly and struck the hour from time to
time, and Honor could hear the faint sound
of the cuckoo. She
remembered the little
bird as long as she
could remember anything;
from babyhood
it had been the delight
of herself and Jim,
with its perky, impertinent
manner, and the
brisk way in which
it bounced out and
in again. Hot tears
blinded Honor's eyes
and soaked into her
pillow.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/image023.jpg" width="383" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SHE LOOKED INTO THE WIDE HALL BELOW."</p></div>
</div>

<p>There came a faint
sound from below, so
faint as only to make
the stillness more
noticeable. The wind
moaned round the
house, but fitfully, as
if a storm were gathering
at a distance.
Honor half sat up in
bed, straining her ear
to listen. There was
not a stir in the
house, yet she felt
convinced that someone
shared her vigil.
Fearing her mother
might be ill, and
yet not wishing to
disturb her if she slept, she drew herself
noiselessly out of bed, and groped for her
dressing-gown without striking a light. On
her way she looked into the wide hall below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
A faint glimmer illumined it, and her eyes
soon became accustomed to the dim light.
Someone stood facing the clock. Click!
the doors flew open, and out sprang the
cuckoo.</p>

<p>One, two, three. The doors closed again.
There was a faint sound, which might have
been a box of matches falling on the tiled
floor. It was followed by a smothered exclamation.
The figure stole away in the
direction of the morning-room, where she
and her mother had lately been sitting.
Honor remained in the dark motionless,
wondering what she had better do. All the
servants were women, and to awaken them
meant rousing her mother, and that she
dare not do.</p>

<p>She gathered her dressing-gown closely
round her and crept noiselessly from stair
to stair, quivering all over as they creaked
under her bare feet, but never pausing until
she stood at the half-open door of the
morning-room and looked in. What she
saw froze her into immovability. A film
swam before her eyes. It was Jim! The
prodigal had returned, but why in this way?
What could it mean? She rubbed her eyes
incredulously. There was another man
standing near the window, but it was upon
Jim her glance was fixed with reluctant,
fascinated horror.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 494px;">
<img src="images/image024.jpg" width="494" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE LIGHT FELL FULL UPON HER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Jim leaned against the mantelpiece, his
face was white and drawn, and in his eyes
was reproduced some of the incredulity of
Honor's.</p>

<p>"I can't, I tell you," he spoke in a low voice,
that yet came clearly to the listener. "I
promised, as it was to be the last time, but I
break my word&mdash;I must get out of this, I tell
you. That clock! My God! what I'd give
not to feel such a scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"<em>Clock?</em> What are you raving about?"
said the other. "What's wrong with the
clock? They must strike, I suppose!
Come on, let's get out of this.
What's given you such a scare?
You might have seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"So I have, the place is full of
them. I must go; the very air
stifles me." He stood upright and
moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"Not a foot until you've done
your share," replied the other,
advancing, and Honor could see his
evil, dissipated face; "don't desert
an old chum."</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven I had years
ago, Hammersley. You've been my
curse ever since I've known you.
Let's clear out."</p>

<p>Honor started at the name, that
of an old school-fellow. She pushed
the door open farther, and the light
fell full upon her, disclosing her
white face with its glittering aureole
of hair, and the blue eyes wide with
pain.</p>

<p>Hammersley dropped the trinket
he held with a little sharp tinkle,
and drew back into the shade
shamefacedly. But Honor never
noticed him, all her glance was for
Jim, who stood rigidly upright,
staring at her as if she were a
visitant from the grave.</p>

<p>"Honor!" the words came with
difficulty from his parched throat.
"<em>You!</em> What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Honor advanced a step nearer.</p>

<p>"<em>Mean?</em>" She spoke in a clear, relentless
voice, half mad with the disgrace of it all.
"Mean? It means that you have sunk so
low as to rob your mother and sister of a few
valuables. It means that you have broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
into your mother's house like a common
thief. No, no&mdash;&mdash;" Her voice vibrated
with a sharp throb of pain&mdash;"even the lowest,
the most degraded, would think twice before
robbing his own."</p>

<p>The light showed clearly all the misery of
Jim's handsome, haggard young face.</p>

<p>"I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but Honor
went on speaking, her voice low with concentrated
scorn, and he drew back under the
lash of her glance.</p>

<p>"Why did you not die years ago? Only
to-night we were talking of you, praying that
you might return, and <em>this</em> is how God
answers our prayers!"</p>

<p>She pointed to the table, and Jim's head
sank lower.</p>

<p>"Take them all if you want them, but go."</p>

<p>He moved blindly
towards the door, and
as he reached it, a footstep
sounded along
the passage, and Mrs.
Latimer appeared.
Before Honor could
stir she had caught
sight of Jim, and putting
down the light she
carried, she made a
little run forward, and
put her arms round
his neck.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my
own boy. I knew you
would come," she said,
and fell inertly with
her cheek against his.</p>

<p>Above his mother's
head, Jim's eyes met
those of Honor, in anguished appeal. As
he stood holding his mother in his arms his
punishment seemed greater than he could
bear.</p>

<p>A fresh fear took possession of Honor, and
for a moment she dared not ascertain the
worst. Had not the doctors talked of a
sudden shock?</p>

<p>"Bring her here," she said, indicating a
couch close by; "she must never know, poor,
poor mother!"</p>

<p>In the bustle that ensued Hammersley
made good his escape, unnoticed by anyone.
Honor applied restoratives, and after a long
time Mrs. Latimer came back to consciousness.
Her glance sought for Jim; Honor
motioned him over.</p>

<p>"My own darling boy, why did you come
back so late? How
thin and white you
are! We must feed
him well, must we
not, Honor?"</p>

<p>She stroked his
face as he bent over
her, and under her
loving trust and entire
unconsciousness
of the true facts of
the case Jim suddenly
broke down, and, like
a penitent child,
buried his face in a
fold of her dressing-gown.
And she
never knew the truth.
But even Honor, who
knows, has perfect
faith now in Jim.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Grant Allen.</span></p>


<h3>I.&mdash;SEXTONS AND SCAVENGERS.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> a certain sense, all animated
nature is but a single vast co-operative
society. I am no
foolish optimist: I will admit,
indeed, that the members of
the society so composed often
display to one another the most unfriendly
and unfraternal spirit. The hawks, for
instance, show a distinct want of true
brotherly love towards the larks or the tom-tits:
and the mice and lizards find the owls
and the cats by no means clubbable. The
co-operative society is hardly what one could
call a happy family. Still, in spite of the
fact insisted upon by the poet that "Nature
is one with rapine&mdash;a harm no preacher can
heal," it is none the less true that a certain
rough balance, an accommodation or adjustment
of part to part, occurs in every department
of animal and vegetable life. When
we come to think, it could hardly be
otherwise. Things can only exist if they
contain in themselves the conditions necessary
to existence. An unadapted animal
or plant perishes instantly. Spiders could
not live in an island which contained
no flies; kingfishers necessarily presuppose
fish; and silkworms imply the
presence of mulberry leaves. You cannot
have vultures wild in a country where there
are no dead animals lying about loose: nor
can you keep bees except where there are
honey-bearing flowers. Dutch clover depends
for its very existence upon a few
insects which fertilize it and set its seeds.
The draining of the fens killed out a dozen
species of English plants and animals; the
inclosure of the prairies deprived the
buffaloes of their chance of pasture. In
this sense, all nature hangs together as it
were; each species fills some place in the
great mosaic which cannot be altered without
considerable disturbance of adjacent pieces.
Destroy the rabbits in a given area, and you
have nothing left for the weasels to feed upon.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, apparently unimportant or
unnoticed creatures perform in the aggregate
some valuable work for the rest of the plant
and animal community, which little suspects
its real indebtedness to them. Darwin
showed long ago that the humble and despised
earthworm was really answerable for
the greater part of that rich layer of vegetable
mould or soil which covers the bare rocks;
it deposits the material in which all our plants
root and from which they derive a large
element of their sustenance. Kill out the
earthworms over the whole of our earth, and
you would reduce a vast proportion of it to
the condition of a desert. For the worms pull
down green leaves into their neat little burrows;
and the refuse of these leaves, continually
renewed from season to season by the industrious
small workmen, forms by far the
greater share of that dark layer of vegetable
mould which is the chief source of the
fertility in plains and lowlands. Sandy upland
spots, where worms are few, form little
or no soil, and will only support a poor moorland
growth of gorse and heather. You
must have plenty of worms if you want to
grow corn or turnips.</p>

<p>But there are other unconsidered creatures
besides these, creatures which perform for
us functions almost as useful and important
as those of the earthworms; and I propose
to devote a few pages here to one such group,
the sanitary commissioners of the insect
world, as I will venture to call them&mdash;the
vast body of minor sextons and six-legged
scavengers. Has it ever struck you that
as you walk abroad through the rich green
meadows and pastures of England, you
almost never come across a dead and decaying
animal? I do not mean large animals
like horses and donkeys: those do sometimes
occur unburied, giving us bold and unpleasant
advertisement of their near presence.
But just consider that the fields through
which you stroll are a perfect warren of moles
and shrews and field-mice and water-voles
and frogs and lizards and rabbits and weasels,
to say nothing of smaller fry; and then think
how seldom on your morning rounds in the
country you come across a single dead bird
or rat or adder, a departed toad, or a late
lamented leveret. The ground about you
teems with life: but where are its cemeteries?
Squirrels and dormice are dying in every
copse: but what becomes of their bodies?
Who ever saw a dead bat? Who knows the
tomb of the deceased hedgehogs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course a great many of the smaller
animals die a violent death, and find their
living grave in the maw of their devourers&mdash;one
must admit that explanation as covering
a very large number of cases. Thirty field-mice
have been disinterred from the stomach
of a single buzzard when it was shot in the
act of digesting after a good dinner; and
owls and snakes are answerable for the fate
of no small proportion of our minuter wild
animals. In other countries, too, vultures
and jackals devour most of the carrion as it
lies; while even in England we have a few
dead-meat-eaters, such as the carrion-crow,
the rat, and the shrike. But for the most
part our rural English public scavengers are
smaller and less conspicuous creatures.
Foremost among them in number and utility
we may reckon the various kinds of burying
beetle.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> find the body of a mouse or
shrew lying unburied in England, it occurs
almost always on a path or high-road. Now
this fact is in itself significant; for the high-road
is practically a man-made desert, so
hardened and steam-rollered, so pounded
and wheel-ridden, that no plant can grow on
it; so exposed that small animals will only
scurry across it for dear life in fear and
trembling; and so difficult to dig into that
no burrowing creature can hope to worm
his toilsome way through it. Hence the
animals that die on the road are
almost never buried; while those
that die in the field or copse are
either eaten at once by larger
beasts, or else decently interred
within a few hours by the sexton
beetles and other established
scavengers. Indeed, a common
superstition exists among country
folk that one of the small long-nosed,
insect-eating animals known
as shrews cannot so much as cross
a road without being killed instantly.
A human track is supposed
to be fatal to them. The
superstition has arisen in this way:
shrews die of cold and hunger in
great numbers at the approach of
winter. A certain proportion of
them perish thus in the open
fields; these, however, are immediately
buried by the proper authorities,
the sexton beetles. But a few happen to
die as they are crossing a road or path;
these lie where they fell, because the
sextons cannot there pierce the hard
ground, and seldom even dare venture
on the road to carry them off to softer
spots for burial. The rustic sees dead
shrews in the road, and none on the open
ground: so he hastily concludes in his easy-going
way that to cross a human path is
sudden death to shrews, who are always
supposed for other reasons to be witch-like
and uncanny animals. If the road leads to
a church, a fatal stroke is specially certain:
for the shrews, like all witch-creatures, hate
Christianity.</p>

<p>I need hardly say, however, that the burying
beetles do not perform their strange
funereal office out of pure benevolence, without
hope of reward. Like human sextons
and undertakers, they adopt their lugubrious
calling for the sake of gain: they expect to
be paid for their sanitary services. The
payment is taken in two forms: one, immediate,
as food for themselves: the other,
deferred, as board and lodging for their
children.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>1.&mdash;GROUPS OF MISCELLANEOUS SEXTON BEETLES, DISCOVERING A DEAD
FIELD-MOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our illustration No. 1 introduces us to a
typical miscellaneous group of these insect
scavengers, occupied in appropriating a very
fine and desirable carcass on which they
have just lighted. A field-mouse, vanquished
by fate in the struggle for existence, has
lately "turned up his toes" in the most
literal sense, and lies unburied, like Archytas,
on the loose sand of a bare patch in a
meadow. All carrion-eating creatures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
remarkable for their powerful sense of smell:
and the sexton beetles, like the vultures and
condors, are no exception to the rule. They
sniff their prey from afar: for where the
carcass is, there shall the carrion beetles be
gathered together. All are eager to take
their share of the feast,
and still more to lay
their eggs in the dead body. Some of them
may crawl up from the immediate neighbourhood;
others, summoned from afar, come
flying on their gauze-like wings from considerable
distances. They are, as a rule,
nocturnal creatures, and they come out on
their burying expeditions by night alone.</p>

<p>The insect just alighting from his flight, in
the upper part of the illustration, is <em>the</em>
burying beetle <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> among our
British kinds; he rejoices (we are always
supposed to rejoice foolishly in our personal
designations) in the dignified title of <i lang="la">Necrophorus
vespillo</i>. In stature he measures
about an inch
long, and he is
a handsome
beast, with two
bright orange
bands on his
hard wing-covers.
The
illustration
shows these
wing-covers
raised, as is the
habit of beetles
when they fly,
while the thin
but powerful
wings beneath
them are expanded
as true
pinions. When
the insect
alights, he folds
the wings up carefully and replaces them
under the hard protective wing-covers: he
is then securely armour-plated from head to
foot, and need fear no foe, save birds which
swallow him whole&mdash;a very tough morsel&mdash;and
hedgehogs which crunch him in their
strong jaws before eating him. However, he
is well prepared for all such enemies, for he
can exude when attacked a very nasty fluid
with a disgusting smell: and this mode of
defence, which resembles that of the skunk
and the polecat, usually protects him from
obtrusive inquirers. He must be handled
with caution, as the perfume he diffuses
spoils woollen clothes and clings to the
fingers after two or three washings.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>2.&mdash;THE SEXTONS AT WORK: BURYING THE BODY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As a rule, when a carcass appears, a pair
of burying beetles of the same species&mdash;a
husband and wife&mdash;fly up to the scene of
operations together and take possession of
the prey; though in the illustration Mr.
Enock has represented several kinds engaged
at once in staking out claims, which indeed
happens often enough in nature. But if you
count the number on any one dead bird or
animal, you will almost always find they are
even in number&mdash;in other words, so many
pairs, male and female. No. 2 shows us the
next act in the funeral drama. The male
beetles, after satisfying their own immediate
hunger, proceed to bury the carcass in a very
curious and laborious manner. You would
wonder how so small a creature could produce
so great a result: the fact is, the beetles
attain their end by continuous under-cutting.
The female hides herself in the body: the
male buries her alive and the dead creature
with her. He
first drags the
mouse, frog, or
bird to a suitable
spot where
the soil is soft
enough to
admit of excavation;
and
sometimes
three or four
males have to
combine for
this purpose.
They then proceed
to dig with
their heads,
which are tools
specialized for
the purpose,
and provided
with strong and
powerful muscles. The antenn&aelig; have also
assumed for this object a short club-shaped
type, very suitable for a navvy's mattock.
The little engineers begin by excavating a
furrow all round the body, and then a second
inside that again, throwing the earth out of
each into the previous one: and so on till
the carcass begins to sink into the hollow.
They then dig and tunnel beneath it, carrying
out loads of earth, one after another, till
bit by bit the carcass collapses into the hole,
first in front, then behind, and has reached a
level considerably below the surface. Then
they throw in the earth they have excavated,
and cover up the body with the females
inside it; after which, I regret to say, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
proceed to hold a very cannibalistic funeral
service above it. The funeral service consists
in eating as much of the body as
they desire for their own purposes: when
they have satisfied their appetite, they
begin to think of the interests of posterity.
The mother beetle proceeds to lay her tale of
eggs in the decently-buried body, for every
animal knows by instinct the precise place in
which to deposit its young and the precise
food which happens to suit them.</p>

<p>After the eggs are laid, the two parent
beetles crawl out of the hole and cover it
carefully up so as to conceal the hiding-place.
So far as they themselves are concerned,
their only object in all this is to
procure food for themselves and
their infant young. But the
wider effects of such scavenger
insects go very far. For we
now know that there is no disinfectant
so good as the top layer
of the soil, which is not really
mere dead earth (as most people
imagine), but a mingled mass of
ramifying life&mdash;a little foundation
of clay and sand intermixed with
endless minute organisms, both
animal and vegetable&mdash;fungi,
bacteria, mites, weevils, and all
sorts of petty creatures, which
eat up and destroy harmlessly
all dead matter subjected to
their influence. The earth is
thus a most admirable deodorizer
and purifier: and burial in its
top layers, the body being freely
exposed to the rapid action of
the devouring microbes, is a most
sanitary mode of disposing of refuse. Thus the
part that is played in the East by vultures and
jackals, or by the wild dogs of Constantinople,
is far more effectually and unobtrusively
played in our fields and meadows by the
many kinds of burying beetles and other
insect scavengers. If we remember how
great a nuisance a single dead rat becomes
in a house, we can faintly picture to ourselves
the debt we owe to these excellent
and unnoticed little sanitary commissioners.
Without them, our fields would not smell so
fresh, nor would our flowers bloom so bright;
for we must remember that by burying the
dead beasts they are not only preventing
disease but also manuring the pastures in
the best possible fashion. The bones of
small animals decay rapidly and make
excellent material for the growth of vegetation.
The beetles as a rule hunt by night
only, and find their prey, as vultures do, by
the sense of smell. When they first find it,
the male hovers above it like an eagle,
circling round and round, so as to point it
out to his mate; the female flies straight to
it, and buries herself without delay in the
rich banquet.</p>

<p>But what becomes at last of the buried
bodies? No. 3 will show you. The female
beetle lays in each body about as many eggs
as she thinks it will support. In a very
short time the eggs hatch out, and the
grubs begin to devour the abundant feast
provided for them. The two grubs to the
right in the illustration are the young of
our friend the orange-banded burying beetle:
the one to the left is a larva of an allied
form known by the poetical name of Silpha.
They set to work at once on the remains
of the mouse, and thoroughly strip the
bones of every fibre of flesh. As soon as
the skeleton is bare, they consider it time to
leave off feeding, and pass on to the second
stage of their existence&mdash;the pupa, or
mummy-case.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/image029.jpg" width="550" height="493" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>3.&mdash;THE GRUBS UNDERGROUND; FEEDING UPON THE BODY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As larv&aelig;, the young burying beetles look
like worms, and have six short legs. No. 4
shows them in the intermediate stage, when
they have retired into a clay cell, or cocoon,
and are undergoing their transformation into
the perfect insect. We are here supposed
to have removed the soil on one side so
as to give a view into the concreted earthen
chambers where the pup&aelig; are changing into
full-grown beetles. You can see the much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
longer legs of the adult insect beginning to
develop, while the head assumes slowly its
later form. The grubs remain in the cocoon
through the winter, and emerge in spring as
winged beetles, when they fly away with their
brilliant wing-cases raised, in search of congenial
mates and more dead field-mice. The
best places to look for all these beetles are
the "keeper's trees," on which game-keepers
hang up the jays and weasels they shoot,
to encourage the others. If you tap one
such dead weasel you will generally find it is
simply swarming with insect life.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image030.jpg" width="500" height="463" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>4.&mdash;NO MORE LEFT! THE GRUBS IN THEIR COCOONS TURNING INTO
BEETLES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Yet, strange to say, even the insect undertakers
themselves are not without their ideas
of beauty and their musical perceptions. The
orange bands of our commonest English kind
have been developed as attractions for their
admiring mates; and the male beetles have
also a musical instrument of their own in
the shape of a peculiar rasp-like ring on
the body, which they can rub against
the wing-cases, and so produce a much-appreciated
chirping. Such instrumental
music is always employed, like the song of
birds, as a charm to heighten the attractiveness
of the suitor: and male burying beetles
may be heard on the evenings of sunny days
competing with one another in musical
contests. Indeed, it often happens that
animals which seem to us disgusting or
unclean display among themselves much
&aelig;sthetic taste, and are gifted with more sense
of beauty or love of music than many other
forms where our human eyes would be more
inclined to look for the presence of these
higher endowments.</p>

<p>I may add that if the beetles left the bodies
in which they laid their eggs to lie above
ground, the bodies would dry up, and the
eggs would run much greater risks. By
burying the dead animal, they provide their
young with food and shelter together, and so
display considerable intelligence.</p>

<p>Another very distinct group of insects
which act as scavengers in a different way in
hotter climates than ours are the famous
scarabs or sacred beetles, worshipped almost
like gods by the ancient Egyptians. English
people know the scarabs best, I think, in the
neighbourhood of Naples, or on
the Lido at Venice&mdash;that great
bank of sand and shingle which
separates the lagoons from the
open Adriatic. When wearied with
sight-seeing at St. Mark's and the
Doge's Palace, we have, most of
us, taken the little steamer that
runs across to the baths on the
Lido, and spent a pleasant hour
or two in picking up shells and
dried sea-horses on the firm belt of
beach that stretches away to Malamocco.
A little inland, the beach
gives way to dry sand-hills, blown
about by the wind, and over-grown
by patches of blue-green marram-grass
and other sandy seaside
weeds. If you lie down on one of
these sand-hills, choosing a spot
not quite so dirty as its neighbours,
you will soon be amused by
seeing a curious little comedy going
on perpetually around you in every
direction. A number of odd-looking
beetles, with long hind legs and very
quaint heads, are occupied with ceaseless
industry in rolling a lot of dark, round balls
almost as big as themselves along the slopes
of the sand-hills. In many places, the whole
ground is alive with the tugging and pushing
little beasts: indeed, when you come to look
close you will find that every half acre of
sand on the Venetian shore or the lower
edge of the Egyptian desert is a perfect city
of these busy wee creatures. Earth is honeycombed
with their holes, towards which
innumerable beetles are continually rolling
their mysterious balls at every possible angle.</p>

<p>Now, what are the balls composed of?
There comes the oddest part of the whole
odd proceeding. The plain truth of it is that
the sacred beetles are assistant scavengers&mdash;imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Southern and Oriental substitutes
for a main drainage system. The balls
consist of dung, dirt, and refuse, and the
beetles collect them on the open, dry them
hard in the sun, roll them to the mouths of
their burrows, and then live on them till the
ball has all been eaten. It is the funniest
thing in the world to watch them. They
tumble about in the loose sand and stumble
over little eminences in the most comical
fashion. No. 5 shows a pair of scarabs
engaged in this habitual and quaint amusement.
They have each collected a round
mass of manure, and rolled and dried it nicely
into shape; they are now engaged in trundling
their booty off at their leisure to
a place of safety. But they are obliged
to push the balls backward with
their long hind legs: and as this
precludes the possibility of the
scarab seeing where it is going,
each beetle pauses every now and again and
turns round, like a man sculling in a boat
alone, to look what is ahead of him. Sometimes
in doing so he loses his ball, a misfortune
which has just happened to the beetle on the
right in No. 5. The precious pellet goes
bounding off down hill as fast as gravitation
will take it. In this case, the disappointed
little workman faces round and darts after it
at full speed, going forward now instead of
backward, and trying to head the ball as it
rolls down the uncertain slope of the sand-hills.
If he succeeds, he puts himself in
front of the ball as it falls, catches it
with his hind legs, and begins once more
laboriously to push it backward up hill
again, towards the mouth of his hole.
But as the pellets roll quickly, and the beetles
are by no means rapid runners, he seldom
succeeds in recovering his own property,
unless the ball happens to catch for a moment
on some projecting little hillock of sand, or
be checked on its downward course by a
weed, a stick, or a dead shell or starfish.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>5.&mdash;SACRED SCARABS ROLLING THEIR FOOD-BALLS BACKWARD (THE INSECT TO THE
RIGHT HAS LOST HIS DINNER).</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, the scarabs, I fear I
must admit, are terrible thieves; and if one
scarab has lost his own ball, and sees some
companion's pellet come rolling down hill
towards him, he will often give up the pursuit
of his lost property, and quietly and
barefacedly appropriate his neighbour's. I
have seen great fights take place at
times over a disputed ball; though sometimes
the combatants agree amicably to
roll it along in common,
and probably share it
when they have reached
their hole. Sometimes,
again, three or four will
unite to roll a ball:
and then, when one
loses it, the others combine
to hold it up or
catch it. I have spent
hours together both in
Egypt and on the Mediterranean
or the Adriatic
in watching the queer
antics of these comic
little commissioners of
drainage: and I never
tire of observing their
odd and unexpected
combinations of interest.
I have sometimes known
the real owner abandon
a ball in despair, from
the unevenness of the
ground, and then seen
a couple of outsiders come up and succeed
in doing what the true owner had been
unable to accomplish.</p>

<p>In No. 6 you see two such scarabs whose
toil has at last been crowned by success, and
who are delivering their balls with joy into
the holes in the sand which form their residences.
As far as I can make out, a pair of
beetles, male and female, seem usually to
share a hole in common, and to roll balls of
food to it either alone or in concert. I cannot
say I have ever seen much co-operation
except between such partners. Once a ball
is secured and safely landed&mdash;for here, as
elsewhere, there's many a slip 'twixt the cup
and the lip&mdash;the happy couple proceed to
eat it up, and apparently do not emerge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
again from their burrow till the supply is
exhausted. Patient naturalists say that one
ball has been known to last a scarab as long
as a fortnight, but this I do not vouch for of
personal knowledge. When more food is
wanted, the couple emerge once more on the
open sand and begin to collect fresh dung
and refuse, which they roll into a new food-ball
and then dry and harden.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>6.&mdash;PRIMITIVE GOLF&mdash;END OF A ROUND: THE SCARABS HOLING THEIR BALLS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Till very lately, it was universally believed
that the female scarab laid an egg in some of
the balls, and that the young grubs hatched
within such food-stocks and began at once to
devour them. This belief has recently been
contradicted with great emphasis by a good
French observer, who opened many balls and
found no eggs; but I cannot accept his conclusion.
I opened numbers of balls myself
near Venice this year, and saw in several one
or two eggs, while in one case (unearthed
from a hole) I discovered a half-grown larva.
I venture therefore in this matter to believe
my own eyes as against those of even the most
celebrated and authoritative entomologists.</p>

<p>In Egypt, it has been universally believed
from all antiquity&mdash;and I think quite rightly&mdash;that
after the scarab has laid an egg
in the ball, the parents unite in rolling it
to a place of safety, above the level of the
annual inundation due to the rise of the
Nile. At any rate, scarabs abound in
Egypt. At a very early date, it would
seem, the curious action of these beetles
attracted the attention of the ancient
Egyptians, whose worship of animals was
one of the most marked features in their
monstrous religion. Hence grew a strange
and widespread superstition. A race which
deified the hawk, the cat,
the ibis, and the jackal
was not likely to overlook
the marvellous proceedings
of the pious and
dutiful scarab. So the
very early Egyptians, we
may conjecture, began
by thinking there must
be something divine in
the nature of an insect
which worked so ceaselessly
on behalf of its
young, and rolled such
big round balls behind it
up such relatively large
hillocks. Watching a
little closer, as time went
on, the Egyptian discovered,
no doubt, that
sacred beetles did not
proceed directly from
sacred beetles, like
lambs from ewes, but
grew, as it were, out of
the dirt and corruption
of the mysterious pellets. A modern observer
would, of course, at once suspect that the
scarab laid an egg inside the ball, and would
promptly proceed to pull one open and look
for it. But that cold scientific method was
not likely to commend itself to the mystic
and deeply religious Egyptian mind. The
priests by the Nile jumped rather to the
conclusion that the scarab collected dirt in
order to make a future scarab out of clay,
and that from this dirt the young beetle
grew, self-existent, self-developed, self-created.
Considering the absence of scientific knowledge
and comparative groups of scientific
facts at the time, such a conclusion was by
no means unnatural.</p>

<p>Once started on so strange a set of ideas,
the Egyptians proceeded to evolve a worship
of the scarab which grew ever and developed,
as they thought the scarab itself did, practically
out of nothing. The immortality of the
soul and the resurrection of the body were
the central ideas of Egyptian religion; the
thinkers of Thebes and Memphis instantly
perceived a fanciful analogy between the
scarab rising from its bed of dirt and the
mummy reviving when the expected day of
resurrection should at last arrive. As a consequence
of this analogy, the scarab was made
sacred: it was reverenced during its life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
often preserved after its death, like the
mummied cats and hawks and sacred Apis
bulls which formed such special objects of
veneration to the devout of Egypt. All sorts
of mystic relations were also discovered
before long in the scarab: its "toes" were
counted as thirty, and held to symbolize
the days of the month: it was said to be
male only, without a female, and so to typify
the creative power and the paternal or
masculine principle in nature. Sun-worship,
as we know, formed a large part of the later
(though not of the most primitive) Egyptian
religion: and the ball rolled by the scarab
was therefore supposed to personify Ra, the
great sun-god. In one way or another, the
sanctity and the mystic implications of the
scarab grew and grew, age after age, until at
last scarab-worship became one of the chief
practical elements in the religion of Egypt.
There was a scarab-headed
god, and scarab hieroglyphs
appear on the face of all
the monuments.</p>

<p>It is as a charm or
amulet, however, that the
ancient Egyptian imitation
scarab is best known.
From a very early period
in the history of the Nile
valley it became usual for
luck's sake to bury some
of these sacred beetles with
the mummy, perhaps alive
(in which case most of
them would no doubt creep
out again) and perhaps also
dead. A few real scarabs
have thus been found here
and there in tombs. But
for the most part, just as
the Egyptians buried little porcelain images
to accompany the mummy, so they buried
porcelain or stone scarabs; and these were
rather closely imitated from the living
insect, but made still more sacred by being
enamelled or engraved with the holy name
of some king or god. Scarabs of this kind,
inscribed with sacred words, and regarded as
talismans, form some of the commonest
objects disinterred in all the Egyptian
excavations: one of them, from a specimen
in the British Museum, is illustrated in
No. 7. Comparison with the live beetles in
the other engravings will show how well the
Egyptians copied nature in this instance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>7.&mdash;AN EGYPTIAN SACRED SCARAB, IN
THE BRITISH MUSEUM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These beautiful and often costly Egyptian
scarabs have been made the subject of very
exhaustive study by various writers, more
particularly by Mr. Loftie and Mr. Flinders
Petrie. The Egyptians did not coin money,
so that scarabs bearing the names of kings
came to have somewhat the same importance
for Egyptian history as coins have for the
history of later civilized nations. Mr. Loftie
traces the origin of the inscribed scarabs to a
very early epoch in the Egyptian annals.
"From the earliest times until the end of
the native monarchy," he says, "certain
usages continued unchanged. Among them
was the inscription of names and texts on
scarabs. The beetle which rolls before it"&mdash;he
ought rather to have said behind it&mdash;"a
ball of mud in which its egg is concealed
was, at some period so remote that we
cannot even approximately date it, seized
upon as the embodiment of the idea of
futurity.... The scarab, burying his egg,
became the symbol of the resurrection, of the
happy time to come, of a
re-creation of all things;
and with every corpse
scarabs were buried, and
scarabs were sewed upon
the shroud, and strung
into a network to cover
the body, and suspended
round the neck, and clasped
in the dead hands. As many
as three thousand scarabs
have been found in one
tomb, and the number in
existence in museums and
private collections is past
count." Some of these
imitation beetles are of
blue pottery, enamelled
outside; but others are of
lapis lazuli, jade, carnelian,
and many other precious
stones. Sacred in themselves by their very
form, that of the revered insect god, they are
rendered still more sacred by their mystic
inscriptions, which consist of appropriate
religious phrases in hieroglyphic writing.</p>

<p>From Egypt, the belief in the luck and
value of engraved scarabs as charms or
amulets passed on to the Greeks, and also
to the Etruscans. Many Greek scarabs
have been found; and in the old Etruscan
tombs such lucky beasts are comparatively
common. They are mostly made more or
less in imitation of the Egyptian originals.
Oddly enough, even the early Christians
themselves did not at once get over the
belief in the sanctity and talismanic character
of the sacred beetle, for the Rev. W. J.
Loftie has pointed out examples of late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
scarabs engraved with undoubted Christian
symbols&mdash;not only crosses but even crucifixes.
In our own days, a slight revival of the
antique superstition has once more taken
place, and some ladies of my acquaintance
wear specimens of the old sacred beetles as
charms in brooches or suspended on their
watch-chains.</p>

<p>Though such numbers of true ancient
scarabs have been unearthed in Egypt, still
the supply of the genuine article does not
quite keep pace with the increasing demands
of the modern tourist: and there is
now a flourishing manufactory of sham
antiques at Luxor, where hundreds of false
scarabs with nice imitation hieroglyphic
inscriptions are neatly turned out for the
market every season.</p>

<p>About sixty different kinds of live scarabs
are known to inhabit the Mediterranean district
in Europe, Asia, or Africa: and four
of these kinds can be easily distinguished
as being individually represented in the old
Egyptian gems. We have no true scarab
of this class living in Britain: but there are
other scavenger beetles which take their
place, the best known being the common
dorbeetle. One of the same family, but
with a quaintly horned head, exists in vast
numbers on the Surrey hills where I have
pitched my tent. The English dung-beetle
burrows in the soft sandstone, and throws
up neat little heaps of clean sand at the
mouth of its hole, like miniature molehills.
Still, our English scavenger beetles&mdash;known
to science as Geotrupes&mdash;are not
nearly so clever or so interesting as the
southern type, for the female in our sort
merely grubs a straight tunnel in the ground,
and lays her egg in a loose mass of dung,
which she drags to the bottom in a shapeless
condition. This beetle utters a plaintive
buzzing cry when it is chasing its mate&mdash;a
soft of "last appeal" which seems calculated
to soften the heart of the hardest lady beetle.
It is as cunning in its way as most others
of its race, for if you catch it in your
hand, it at once draws in its legs to its
side and "shams dead." All the English
and foreign scavenger beetles perform
a useful task by following up animals
and clearing away their refuse; indeed,
a special kind of beetle lays itself out as
scavenger for each species of large animal,
one kind being attached to the cow, one
to the donkey, one to the camel, and
so on through a long list of patrons and
satellites.</p>

<p>You will thus see that in this wider sense
all creation moved together like a vast joint-stock
co-operative society, each kind working
consciously for its own good alone, but each
also in a certain deeper and unconscious way
contributing to the general well-being of all,
by its exercise of some special function.
Nevertheless, the function is always performed
by each plant or animal itself for its own
purposes; it only incidentally serves to
benefit the others. Thus the burying beetles
and the scavenger beetles work first of all
and ostensibly for their own food and
the food of their offspring: it is merely
as an incidental result, undesigned by themselves,
that they assist in purifying the air
and the soil for all other species. Or, to
put it still more simply, while these industrious
little creatures are working individually
for their own ends, they are also in the wider
scheme of nature working unconsciously and
almost unwillingly in the service of others.
Nature bribes each kind, as it were, by some
personal advantage to perform good work for
the benefit of the totality.</p>

<p>The good work performed by the scavengers
may be thus summed up. If dead bodies
and the refuse of food were left about everywhere
freely on the open, germs of disease
and putrefaction would fly about much
more commonly than even at present. But
a large number of scavenger animals,
scavenger birds, and scavenger insects&mdash;hyenas,
vultures, burying beetles, and so
forth&mdash;act as public servants to prevent this
calamity. Again, the earth needs the bodies
and the refuse as fertilizers: and many of
the scavengers carry down such materials
into the first layer of the soil, where they
become of enormous use in promoting the
freer growth of vegetation. Thus, long
before men learnt to bury their dead or to
manure their fields, nature had invented
both these processes, and registered them,
so to speak, in the instincts and habits of a
special class of insect sextons and sanitary
inspectors. It is always so in life. There
is hardly a human trade or a human activity
which does not find its counterpart somewhere
in animal or vegetable life: and it
will be my object, in future numbers of these
papers, to set before you in other directions
some such natural anticipations or foreshadowings
of man's inventions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Private William Fox</span>
was swaggering down the road
to Shorncliffe Camp; that is
to say, he was trying to swagger
as much as his 5ft. 2in. of
stature would allow. For the
prettiest girl in Folkestone was holding on
affectionately to his left arm, and in his right
hand he displayed to full advantage his new
silver-topped cane, the result of several
weeks' savings.</p>

<p>"Little Willie," as his comrades of the
210th line called him, was the most
"special" of "special enlistments." He
had enlisted at a time when a war scare
was running riot throughout the country,
and the inspector-surgeon had passed
him, saying that he was sure to grow to
standard height as he was only just eighteen,
although it was evident to anyone who
glanced at the set look of his shoulders that
he would never be a hair's-breadth taller
than he was. It was certainly rather trying
to his three-month-old martial dignity to
have the street urchins asking him as he
strutted through the town whether "his ma
knew he was out"&mdash;but that was nothing to
the jeers of the men of his company, and
Little Willie had not found the life of a soldier
of the Queen as alluring as the recruiting
sergeant had painted it.</p>

<p>But on this particular summer afternoon
he had forgotten all that, for was not Nellie,
his own little Nellie, tripping along by his
side?&mdash;and he never thought of his grievances
when she smiled those sunny smiles of hers.
He had known her for years; as children
they had made mud-pies in the gutter
together, and when he was a little older he
used to spend the pence he got for holding
horses and running errands in sweets for
Nellie; and now that they were grown up,
and that she was in service and he was
wearing a red coat, they "walked out"
together, and talked of getting married.</p>

<p>"When I get my stripes, Nell, we'll get
spliced, thet's what we'll do."</p>

<p>Nell nodded her assent.</p>

<p>"'Ow long'll thet be, Will?"</p>

<p>"Not so very long, neither," he said, his
boyish face lighting up with the ambition of
a future field-marshal&mdash;"a year or two, maybe,
maybe less&mdash;they're a-wanting good,
steady men loike me."</p>

<p>Here a loud voice behind them put an end
to further confidences. "Ullo, little 'un,
where are yer a-going, so 'aughty-like? Yer
won't as much as look at a pal!"</p>

<p>The two stopped and looked round as Big
Bob finished his sentence, Willie with disgust
written on every feature, Nellie with unqualified
admiration in her brown eyes. Big
Bob was accustomed to that sort of thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
from the girls he condescended to talk to;
he was certainly a very handsome man&mdash;fair,
curly hair, a fierce moustache, and light-blue
eyes that looked down protectingly on
womankind in general. So without further
ado he ranged up on the other side of Nellie
with a "Pleased to meet yer, miss."</p>

<p>For the rest of that walk poor Little Willie
was decidedly "out of it." He had to dodge
lamp-posts and walk on the curb, so that his
six-foot rival should not be forced into the
hedge on the other side; however, there was
one consolatory thought in his mind, namely,
that if Nellie managed to impress Big Bob
favourably&mdash;as he had little doubt she would&mdash;the
latter perhaps would give up making
Willie's barrack-room life a burden to him.</p>

<p>Nellie <em>did</em> make a good impression on Big
Bob; but, alas, for poor little Willie, it was not
a one-sided affair. Next time the two lovers
went for a stroll, Nell was distinctly patronizing.</p>

<p>"Why don't yer grow, Will? Yer ain't as
tall as me by a inch, and yer does look small
in a red coat!"</p>

<p>This was an awful blow; up till now,
Nellie had been the only one person who
told him he looked well in his uniform, and
now that she should turn on him like this!</p>

<p>"Garn!" he answered, "where's the use
in bein' a lamp-post?"</p>

<p>"But Big Bob&mdash;I mean Mr. Jones&mdash;'e ain't
no lamp-post. 'E's a good sight broader in
the shoulders than ever you'll be. Why, 'e'd
make two of yer, 'e would!"</p>

<p>"Well, 'e don't draw no double pay, no
'ow, and don't yer forget it, neither!"</p>

<p>After half an hour's walk these amenities
produced a decided coolness, and when Big
Bob strolled up and offered them the pleasure
of his company, it was a great relief to both.
But Little Willie felt very miserable indeed
when he thought over the day's events, as he
lay on his hard barrack bed that night and
courted sleep in vain.</p>

<p>"I'll make it up with her on Sunday," he
kept on saying to himself by way of consolation.
But when Sunday came round again,
after a long, weary week of bullying, Nellie
was absent from the rendezvous, and he
wandered disconsolately all over Folkestone
in the hope of meeting her. He did meet
her&mdash;but hanging proudly on the stalwart
arm of Bob Jones! Poor Willie did not
even reply to her "Good afternoon," but
went straight back to his cheerless barrack-room
and spent the remainder of the day in
putting a vicious polish on his captain's sword
and buttons, by way of relieving his feelings.</p>

<p>Captain Archie Trevor was Little Willie's
hero&mdash;he worshipped him at a distance, and
proved his devotion by the care he took of
that officer's effects. Captain Trevor's boots
were the admiration of the parade, and even
the colonel wondered how they always looked
so bright and spotless. Willie was an ideal
soldier's servant, and was quite happy if he
won an occasional word of approbation from
his hero; for Willie had never forgotten
how, during his first march-out with the
battalion, when he was staggering along
under his heavy rifle, with blistered feet and
aching legs, wondering how long it would be
before his knees gave way altogether, his
stalwart captain had come up and cheered
him with a few words, and had carried his
rifle for him all the rest of the long, weary
day. "I'd give a month's pay, thet I would,
to shake 'ands with the captain," he had
afterwards said to a comrade, in a burst of
confidence; and so it came about that there
was never such an ideal soldier's servant as
Little Willie.</p>

<p>That evening A Company had a "smoker"
in one of the disused huts of Shorncliffe
Camp. The hut was packed with unbelted
warriors, who joined noisily in the choruses
of the popular songs, and passed round
buckets of beer to wet their throats between
whiles. Little groups of men were sitting
smoking all over the room, some on biscuit-tins,
some on benches and tables, all chatting
and laughing amongst themselves, and occasionally
shouting spicy and personal remarks
to the performers, who used a table as a
stage, and were not loth to pause in the
middle of a song and accept a drink from a
proffered mug or pail.</p>

<p>One occupant of the room, however, took
little interest in the proceedings. Willie had
perched himself in a corner, where he sat
unnoticed; why he had come at all he did
not know. Perhaps it was that anything was
preferable to the deserted barrack-room in
his present state of mind. There he sat on
an upturned pail, with an untouched mug of
beer beside him, giving no heed to what
went on around, dismally busy with his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"What-ho, Willie," cried Big Bob, as he
espied him for the first time. "What yer so
quiet about?"</p>

<p>Willie gave an imperceptible shudder as
the bully shouldered his way through the
intervening groups. "'Ere, boys, Little
Willie's goin' to give us a cormic song!"</p>

<p>A roar of applause greeted this announcement,
and several of Willie's particular
tormentors closed up around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I carn't sing to-night," protested the
victim, feebly.</p>

<p>"More yer can any other time!"</p>

<p>Another round of applause followed this
sally.</p>

<p>"Ain't yer going to offer us a tip at yer
mug?" Big Bob said, as he caught up the
tankard from the floor.</p>

<p>"In course, if yer ain't wet enough
already," answered Willie.</p>

<p>"Mates," said the offended one, pointing
dramatically at the youth on the bucket&mdash;"Mates,
the nipper's 'inted as 'ow I'm
squiffy! Then take yer bloomin' tipple;
Oi'll 'ave none of it!" and he poured the
whole contents of the pot over the luckless
young soldier.</p>

<p>Willie rose with an angry flush, but someone
from behind caught him by the ankle
and sent him rolling to the floor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/image037.jpg" width="636" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WEEPIN' WILLIE, TAKE THET."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"So-o-o, yer wants to fight, does yer?"
cried Big Bob, as he jerked the lad to his
feet again. "What proice thet, Sandow!"
and he administered a terrific box on the ear
to the half-dazed Willie. It was by no means
the first time that Willie had "gone through
the mill," but he was getting rather sick of
the process, and resolved to show fight.</p>

<p>"Yer bloomin' set of bullies!" he blurted
out. But just then a leg from the encircling
crowd neatly tripped up our young gallant
and deposited him on the floor again. Once
more he struggled to his feet, but as he
looked round the circle of grinning faces,
all many inches above him, and as he
thought of his own dear little Nellie "walking
out" with the fellow who was making
his life unbearable, he felt a lump rise in his
throat; his fists unclenched, and in another
second he had sunk down on the upturned
bucket, sobbing as if his heart would break,
and his hot tears mingled with the beer that
was trickling from his hair.</p>

<p>"Law lumme, he's acshally <em>weepin'</em>!"</p>

<p>A roar of derision and disgust rose from
the astonished soldiers. Then every man
solemnly fetched his drink, and poured it
over the prostrate lad. "'Weepin' Willie,'
take thet," was the formula, as each man
upset the contents of his can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and
those who stood nearest it drew themselves
up to "attention" as Captain Trevor, who
had heard the noise as he was passing by,
strode into the room.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said, addressing the
crestfallen gang of tormentors. "Off you
all go to your barrack-rooms at once, and
don't let this ever happen again in A Company."</p>

<p>They were only too glad to get off so
easily, and in less than a minute Captain
Trevor and Private Fox were alone.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Fox? Why,
surely, man, you've not been <em>crying</em>!"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I couldn't 'elp it, I did feel
so wretched like."</p>

<p>"You've left school now, remember that&mdash;we
don't have men who <em>cry</em> in the army.
Get back to your room at once, and
don't let me ever see you in this state
again. I am disappointed in you, Fox."</p>

<p>Poor Willie, sick at heart and sore
in limb, crept back to his barrack-room,
where he was greeted with
jeers and hoots, but, mindful of
Captain Trevor's warning, his comrades
abstained from stronger
measures that night.</p>

<p>The months that followed made
his life a perfect pandemonium. All
his room-mates taxed their ingenuity
to the utmost in order to devise new
tortures and humiliations for
"Weepin' Willie."</p>

<p>His bed was always soaking wet,
his kit and accoutrements hidden
away. They painted his buttons,
they whitewashed his boots, they
borrowed his blankets. When a
man could not sleep, he whiled
away the hours of the night by
throwing the heaviest missiles he
could lay his hands on at the luckless
youth. On wet afternoons
Willie was "crucified" for the public
amusement, a process which consisted
in tying up the patient's wrists
just above the door, so that whenever
it was opened he got a severe
jerking. And yet through it all he
never showed fight and never complained,
but bore blows and jibes
alike with stolid indifference.
Although Captain Trevor never
alluded to that awful night, Willie
instinctively felt that his hero
despised him, and that hurt him
more than all the ill-usage of
his room-mates. Nellie he had not seen
since, but she had scribbled him a line in
pencil.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. 'Weepin' Willie</span>,'&mdash;You're a disgrace
to the army. I hope never to see you
again till you've got given up crying.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nellie
Lindon.</span>"</p>

<img src="images/image038.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"SHE APPLIED A CORNER TO HER EYES."</p></div>
</div>

<p>This masterpiece of sarcasm Willie kept in
the lining of his tunic, and it made him mad
every time he thought of it. And so the
weary weeks passed by until the trooping
season came, and then, much to the delight
of all the men, A Company was ordered out
to the North-West frontier to join the first
battalion as a draft to make good the ravages
caused by sickness and the enemy. As the
train steamed out of the station, Willie saw
Nelly Lindon waving her handkerchief to
Big Bob, and as his carriage moved slowly
past, she applied a corner to her eyes as if
wiping away an imaginary tear, but there
was a mischievous smile on her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>"Them's the beggars we've got to smash;
look at 'em a-wasting of their ammunition,
as if hevery round on it wasn't stolen from
the Govermint."</p>

<p>"That'll make some of the boys perspirite,
I'm thinking," Sergeant Thomson replied, as
his eyes followed the direction of Big Bob's
finger.</p>

<p>Half a mile or so from where the company
was halted to refresh itself after its tedious
semi-circular march in the early dawn, a long
sloping hill, covered with stunted growth and
unsteady boulders, rose gradually up to the
sky-line; some little way below the summit,
a ledge of rock ran parallel with the top, and
it was at this ledge that Captain Trevor
directed his field-glasses.</p>

<p>"I'll send the men up to that ledge in
skirmishing order," he said to one of his
lieutenants. "They'll be protected from the
enemy's fire once they get there, then we
can re-form and do the rest with a rush; I
don't suppose it's more than a hundred and
fifty yards to the summit from there. What
do you think, Mason?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so; anyway I hope
not, as we've got to do it, and the general
will be coming along on the far side in
another couple of hours. By Jove, Trevor,
we'd better hurry up," he added, as he looked
at his watch. "We must clear those fellows
off the summit by six o'clock, and it's nearly
half-past four now. How many of them are
there, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Only a couple of hundred, I suppose,
but if we don't clear them out of that they
could play the very devil with the brigade;
it's a sheer drop of 200ft. into the road from
where they are, and they'd be rolling those
great boulders on to the fellows' heads.
Company, fall in. 'Tention! You will advance
in skirmishing order up to that ledge
of rock. Section commanders to keep their
men well in hand and to make the best use
of every bit of cover. Now, remember, no
target-shooting at those niggers on the sky-line!
What I want you to do is to get to
that ledge as quickly and with as little loss
as possible. The men will widen out as far
as they can, so as to offer no mark for
the enemy's sharp-shooters. Section commanders,
tell off your men!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later the company was
straggling along over the broken ground in
one long line, with wide gaps between the
men, who were left more or less each to take
care of himself and choose his own way.</p>

<p>"Blow me if we ain't a-going to 'ave a
treat now!" Big Bob shouted to Little Willie,
who was staggering along under the weight of
his rifle half-a-dozen yards to Bob's left, as a
bullet went whistling in between them. As
the big man spoke his foot caught in a trailing
creeper, and he measured his length on
the ground, his rifle going off as he fell.</p>

<p>Immediately a young recruit on the right,
hearing the report, and longing to have a
shot at the enemy, brought his rifle up to the
"ready," took careful aim, and fired. Nothing
is so contagious as contagion. In five
minutes the whole line were taking pot-shots
at the black figures on the sky-line. In vain
did the captain and his two lieutenants curse
and threaten the men nearest them; in vain
did the non-commissioned officers urge their
men forward&mdash;it was impossible to do anything.
The men were all over the place,
some of them a hundred or more yards
apart, some lying down behind boulders
taking aim, others running forward a few paces,
and then discharging their rifles from
the cover afforded by bushes or rocks. As
they gradually worked their way upwards,
the tribesmen's good shooting began to take
effect. First one man dropped, then another;
then one of the lieutenants threw up his
hands and fell forward, shot through the
heart in the act of kicking a man who was
having a little private nigger-shooting
competition with his corporal. As the men
saw their comrades fall they got more and
more chary of exposing their own persons,
preferring to lie low and waste ammunition
on the sky-line.</p>

<p>Pitter-patter went the bullets on the stone-strewn
hill-side, and the soldiers crawled a
little closer up to their sheltering rocks and
bent their heads down a few inches lower.
There was not a man there whom you could
have called a coward with impunity. Had
they been all together&mdash;in line or column&mdash;they
would have gone up the hill like a herd
of buffaloes, with wild cheers and gleaming
bayonets, and never given a thought to the
dead and wounded. But, scattered as they
were over the whole hill-side, with only now
and then a comrade's white sun-helmet
coming in sight, it was too much to expect
of any man with a loaded magazine and
clear view of the enemy that he should go
on up, alone for all he knew, with the bullets
singing around him.</p>

<p>In vain had Captain Trevor called the men
nearest him a pack of white-livered curs; in
vain had he referred to their parents and
antecedents in terms that would have shocked
and astonished his eminently respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
aunt, the Dowager-Countess of Trevordine.
At last he gave it up in despair. "Lie there,
you infernal idiots, and blaze your ammunition
away. I'll be cursed if <em>I</em> stand and
score for you!" And, fuming with impotent
rage, he returned his sword to its scabbard
with a vicious click, placed his hands in his
pockets, and continued the ascent alone.</p>

<p>"Just as if 'e was goin' on a Halpclimbin'
hexpedition," as one of the men
remarked.</p>

<p>"'E'll git a bloomin' 'ole knocked in his
carcuse afore 'e's gone fur," Big Bob yelled
to the man nearest him, as he refilled his
magazine and settled his elbows preparatory
to wasting more cartridges.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"ONE OF THE LIEUTENANTS THREW UP HIS HANDS AND FELL FORWARD."</p></div>
</div>

<p>How Captain Trevor ever reached the
sheltering ridge which was to have been
the rendezvous remains a mystery; but
reach it he did without a scratch. One
man alone was there to welcome him:
"Weepin' Willie" furtively drew his sleeve
across his mouth to try and disguise the
fact that he was munching a commissariat
biscuit, and stood at attention as his officer
came up. It was Willie's first experience of
active service, and he did not know if it was
etiquette to be seen breakfasting while under
fire.</p>

<p>"That you, Fox? D&mdash;&mdash; it, man, give
me your hand! You're the only man fit to
be a soldier in the whole company."</p>

<p>Willie blushed up to his ears with delight.
At last he had retrieved himself in his hero's
estimation. Almost reverently, he took the
captain's outstretched palm.</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sir," he said. "Oi've been
wishin' for this ever since ye carried my rifle
that day!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, my man. Let's have a
look at your rifle." He looked down the
polished barrel. "You don't mean to tell
me you haven't fired a shot yet?"</p>

<p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir, thin I did misunderstand
yer. I thought as 'ow I 'adn't
'eard aright when I saw all the other blokes&mdash;I
mean fellers, sir&mdash;a-blazin' away. But
as I ain't much of a shot I thought I'd be on
the safe soide, and I certingly did think as
'ow you'd told us not to shoot."</p>

<p>"I'll get you to repeat that in front of the
whole company, Fox, if I can ever get them
out of this cursed mess; it would be a lesson
to them."</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, and still not another
man had reached the rendezvous. Away
down beneath them, some two, some three,
and some four hundred yards away, the little
white helmets could be seen from time to
time as the skirmishers altered their positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/image041.jpg" width="480" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THAT YOU, FOX? GIVE ME YOUR HAND."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I'm going to see what the enemy are up
to," Captain Trevor said, as he clambered up
the seven-foot ledge of rock that was sheltering
the two men. "Perhaps those beggars
down there will see me then and come up!"</p>

<p>"Weepin' Willie" followed in the wake of
his officer, and there the two stood in full
view of their own men, and a splendid
mark for the enemy. Once Willie almost
ducked as a bullet "ventilated" his helmet,
and the next moment Captain Trevor staggered,
and would have fallen had not the
private caught him in his arms.</p>

<p>Carefully, and exerting all his strength,
for Trevor was a big man, Willie lifted him
over his shoulder, and began slowly to
descend from the ridge; but, as he gave a
last look round, he saw the tribesmen on
the summit suddenly leap to their feet, and,
brandishing their murderous knives, begin
to rush down the incline. In an instant,
Willie was up on the ledge again, and with
the full force of his lungs&mdash;and his lungs
were the only big thing about him&mdash;he
shouted to his comrades below: "Run,
yer blazing beggars, run! They're on
yer!" And then, with all the speed
his feeble legs would allow, he clambered
off the ridge and began to
stagger down the hill, the captain's long
legs trailing on the ground behind,
scraping against the loose stones and
starting them rolling. On the little man
stumbled, his knees giving under his
heavy burden, his breath coming in
short sobs, and his heart beating like
a steam-hammer. What if he failed
to save his hero!</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of a big
man in "khaki" towering above him.
"Here, lad, give 'im to me!" and
a pair of strong arms lifted the captain
easily, as Willie recognised Big
Bob's voice. A cheer went up
from below as Lieutenant Mason
and a dozen men with gleaming
bayonets came dashing up the
slope. The tribesmen, who were
just coming over the ridge above,
saw the little band, saw the fierce,
determined look on their faces,
the blood-for-blood battle-lust
in their eyes. "Illah Allah,"
shouted the chief, "these are no
coward-women after all!" and
discharging his rifle haphazard,
scrambled down the ledge the
way he had come. In less time
than it takes to tell, the dusky
warriors were laboriously following their
chief to the summit again, closely pursued
by the Englishmen, while all along
the slope white helmets and bright steel
flashed in the rising sunlight, as one after
another the men leaped to their feet and
rushed upwards. In five minutes the
struggle was over, and just as the dusty, blood-stained
men were opening their haversacks
to snatch a hurried breakfast, a troop of the
Guides cavalry, the advance guard of the
brigade, came clattering along the mountain
road two hundred feet beneath them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a proud day for A Company when
all the Fingal Valley Brigade were paraded in
hollow square to see private Fox receive the
Victoria Cross, and no man cheered louder
than Big Bob.</p>

<p>"'Weepin' Willie' yer is, and 'Weepin'
Willie' yer'll remain," he afterwards said to
the hero of the day, as all his comrades
gathered round to shake his hand. "I'd
weep the 'ole bloomin' day if I thought it'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
make me behave as well as yer did under fire,
'ang me tight if I wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"Aye! And if yer hasks my opination, 'e
was weepin' cos 'is messmates was such a
bloomin' lot of coward, low-'earted skunks!
And so we are&mdash;compared with 'im, leastwise&mdash;ain't
we, mateys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Rayther!" was shouted on
all sides.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/image042.jpg" width="460" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"ON THE LITTLE MAN STUMBLED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then someone got on a commissariat
biscuit-box: "Three cheers for 'Weepin'
Willie,' our little nipper, the bravest man
in all the bloomin' brigade!" And the
galvanized iron roof fairly rattled an accompaniment
to the lusty lungs of A Company.</p>

<p>The day after the 1st Battalion of Her
Majesty's 210th Line&mdash;late of the Fingal
Valley Field Force&mdash;was landed at Plymouth,
Nellie Lindon received a registered envelope
which contained many things. One was a
dirty scrap of paper with a few words in
pencil on it, that had been carried all
through a campaign concealed in the lining
of a private's tunic. Then there was a
plain gun-metal Maltese cross with the
words "For Valour" graven thereon; and,
lastly, a line or two from Big Bob: "Take
my advice, Nell," he wrote, "and have the
nipper."</p>

<p>And Nell did.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Many</span> of the instances of animal
sagacity with which we have
been familiar from our youth
have had but slender foundation
of fact, upon which is
erected a terribly airy superstructure
of fiction. In Mr. Shepherd's
"Animal Actualities," and in the present
article, however, the anecdotes about our
lower friends are authentic&mdash;vouched for, in
fact, by their various
owners&mdash;while the
photographs from life
are indisputable evidence
of their truth.</p>

<p>The dog, as is to
be expected, from his
occupying a position
which places him
under constant observation,
forms the subject
of more stories
than any other animal;
yet it is not known
how far his intelligence
extends. Some
enthusiasts aver that
instances are on record where a member of
the canine race has committed suicide
through grief; but this certainly requires
verification. Let us listen to Mr. G. C.
Grove, however, who tells the story of "The
Inseparables." He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot refrain from telling the following
story, which is vouched for by my most
intimate friend. On paying a visit to his
uncle, who is a farmer in Scotland, he
noticed a handsome young collie and a
goose with a broken wing, constantly about
together; indeed, they were well-nigh inseparable.
On inquiry he elicited the fact
that, when a puppy, the dog had flown at a
gosling and had broken its wing; ever since,
it was noticed that the dog was not only
cognizant of the mischief he had done, but
became so repentant, that from that time
forward he had taken
that one bird under
his special protection,
though his feeling towards
geese in general
remained unchanged;
and now, wherever the
dog goes, there follows
the goose, and <em>vice
vers&acirc;</em>. It is a pretty
instance of contrition,
and may be recommended
as a useful
example."</p>

<p>One would have
thought from stories
that have come from
Australia that dogs and kangaroos were inveterate
enemies. In our illustration we seem,
however, to have a direct refutation of such an
erroneous belief. We have here five dogs and
a kangaroo, the Australian placidly munching
some carrot-heads. There has been no posing
about this picture: the subjects settled themselves
together in the most natural fashion.</p>

</div>

<p>The dog has not only proved himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
be man's best friend, but he seems to show a
great deal of affection for other animals with
which he may happen to come in contact, either
as occasional friends or more often as constant
companions. We have here, for instance, a
number of photos. showing the marvellous
way in which animals fraternize as though
they belonged to one family. Professor
Lorenzo, of 5, Crowndale Road, N.W., has a
most extraordinary collection of animals of
all kinds. It includes dogs, cats, tame rabbits
and wild rabbits, kangaroos, bantams,
pigeons, cockatoos and parrots, and other
pets. Among these we find a friendship
which is of many years' standing. A
spaniel and bantam
are not often seen
together, yet we
have them here in
thorough good-fellowship.
The dog is
a lovable creature,
and the bantam
knows it.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SPANIEL AND BANTAM.</p>

<p><cite>From a Photo. by A. J. Johnson.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>That very bantam,
by the way, is
the most cheeky
fellow in creation.
He does not believe
in roosting in
orthodox fashion;
but chooses, in preference,
some soft, velvety surface whereupon
he can settle at ease and remain as
long as he pleases. As shown in the next
picture, a cat is another friend of his. Puss
is almost crushed by the weight of this most
unblushing intruder, yet she does not move,
lest she should interfere with his comfort.</p>

<p>Cats and rabbits next come under notice.
It may be interesting to quote a pretty story
told by Miss Hamond, of Cheltenham. She
says: "The following incident occurred under
my own eyes during my residence in Spain.
The province of Jaen, in sunny Andalusia,
is rich in minerals, and the quaint old
country town of Linares may be called the
centre of the lead-mining
district, where a
goodly number of
Englishmen have settled
down with their wives
and families and household
gods, to make the
best of life under conditions
very different
from those to which
they were born.</p>

<p>"The children&mdash;as
children do all the world
over&mdash;used to keep a
good many pets of
different kinds, and in
one household which
I often visited&mdash;that of
Mr. Romer, manager to
one of the mining companies&mdash;their
name was legion. One afternoon
when I came in to tea there was a
great commotion in the yard; obviously
something important had happened. I knew
at once that it must be a new kind of pet
which somebody had given them.</p>

<p>"'One of the miners has brought us some
infant rabbits,' said Conchita, the second
girl, hardly able to speak from ill-suppressed
excitement. 'They are such babies, they
can't feed themselves; do advise us. They
will die if they are not fed soon.' A piece
of rag dipped in milk seemed the only way
out of the difficulty; the infants took to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
at once. Indeed, they soon began to nibble
at the milk in the saucer. This problem
was evidently solved, but the weather was
very cold, and they had doubtless been accustomed
to a warm fur cloak about them. So
Conchita said, 'Might she take them to bed
with her?'</p>

</div>

<p>"'Take them in to Molly, and see if he
will adopt them,' I suggested, not intending
to be taken at my word; but Conchita
thought it an excellent idea, and acted upon
it at once. We all followed her. (I must
explain here that Molly was an immense
tom-cat, fat and amiable; he lived in the
schoolroom in a wadded basket, which just
fitted him comfortably.) 'He will eat them
up at once, of course,' remarked one of
the bystanders, 'and perhaps it is just as
well that he should.' But he didn't. That
excellent cat allowed the mites to be
stuffed into his lap; they at once nestled
down and Molly went off to sleep again.
Some of us looked in later in the evening to
see what had happened. That excellent cat
was sitting up washing the rabbits! It
was the funniest thing in the world: he
evidently remembered his own nursery days,
and was doing his duty according to his
lights by his strange charges. When he
came to the long ears he
paused, evidently mildly surprised
at the innovation, but
those rabbits had a thorough
licking before they finally retired
to rest. This sort of
thing went on for a fortnight,
the rabbits feeding out of
Molly's saucer of bread and
milk with him regularly, though
it soon had to be changed for
a soup-plate, and a bigger bed
had to be provided. At the
end of the fortnight the
rabbits began to take so
much exercise that it was
difficult to keep them in one
room, and there were so
many ferocious cats in the
neighbourhood that Conchita
decided that the rabbits
must be provided with
a hutch of their own, and
so the pretty little comedy
came to an end. It never
seemed to have occurred to
the amiable Molly that they
were good to eat. We used
to bring friends&mdash;scoffers
and unbelievers, who went
out converted&mdash;to that schoolroom, and if
Molly, the conscientious foster-father, were
sleepy and indisposed to show off, we used
to put a little butter on the infants' backs.
This never failed to wake him up and induce
him to perform their toilet with much
energy."</p>

</div>

<p>One of our Australian friends, who prefers
his name not to be published, but whose
statements we have very good reasons to
believe to be absolutely true, sends us the
extraordinary photo. given below. "Away
out in New Zealand," our kindly correspondent
was able to take this curious picture.
He tells the following story in connection
with it: "Everyone knows how
deficient in sense of maternal responsibility
are mother ducks, and some ducklings of
mine, appearing neglected, were put into a
small box, with flannel, to add to their
comfort. As one of our cats happened to
be present, and inspected them with some
interest, my wife said to her, 'Here are
some kittens for you, Minna.' Without
more ado Minna jumped into the box, and
there and then adopted them as her very
own. When they fell out of the box, she
very tenderly picked them up in her mouth
and replaced them. When they pecked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her after the manner of their kind, she very
gently reproached them with her paw, and
seemed to try and tell them in her own
language that she had never seen well-behaved
kittens behave in that way before.
Altogether they became a very happy family."
Our correspondent
says nothing
of their
ultimate fate, but
we would imagine
that when
the ducklings
first took to the
water, the foster-mother's
grief
must have been
extremely touching.
"On another
occasion, however,"
adds the
owner of the
ducklings, "I
was standing,
one evening,
watching my
Aylesburys waddling
home to
supper and bed
after 'a happy
day at the seaside,'
when I
noticed a little
black-and-white duckling evidently not theirs,
which to my surprise was with them. It
stopped and looked at me as the others
passed, and seemed to ask, 'What are
you going to do with me?' I picked it
up and called the old cat. Putting the
duckling in a box, I said, 'There is another
kitten for you, Minna.' Without a moment's
hesitation she once more
undertook her strange
maternal duty, and took
charge of the mite for some
days, till she thought the
little one old enough to face
a hard and cruel world by
itself. The duckling, which
was called Kitty after its
foster-mother, used to follow
her about the garden and up
and down the veranda stairs.
At last, however, some boys&mdash;for
there are cruel and
thoughtless boys even in
New Zealand&mdash;killed it with
a stone."</p>

<p>Of foster-mothers we have
indeed some extraordinary instances. They
show the truthful confidence with which little
suckling animals will approach, and regard
as their mother, beasts of quite a different
species. We have here two instances of suckling
pigs. In the one case we have an amusing
picture, showing
how the little
porker was
caught in the act,
not only by the
camera, but by
the jolly farmer
in the background.
Stealing
milk from a cow,
whose yield in
consequence fell
noticeably short,
was an injudicious
thing to do,
but it would not
have mattered
much had piggie
not been caught.
The second
photo., which
exemplifies a
peculiar coincidence,
was sent
in by Mr. J. A.
Hern, of Wayne,
Nebraska, U.S.A.
It is a striking confirmation of the preceding
incident, with the difference that, instead of
one thief only, we have three, and already
well satisfied they look.</p>

<p>Another peculiar pair hail from the States.
They live in Walsenburg, Colorado, the
photo being sent in by Mr. Thomas Bunker,
of that town. The mother ass in this case is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a most interesting animal. Her ordinary
occupation is that of wood-carrier, as may be
gathered from the load on her patient back;
but besides having to suckle her own offspring,
standing so gloomy, sad-eyed, and reproachful
on the right, she also has to nurse the
exuberant little lamb seen in the very act of
robbing the little donkey foal of its natural
right. The three animals belong to an old
Mexican, and the lamb was reared entirely
on the milk of the mother ass.</p>

<p>The pretty terrier shown in the next illustration
was once the happy mother of an
even happier family. Unfortunately, the
puppies all died soon after birth, leaving the
mother broken-hearted. For a long while
the dog was inconsolable. It refused its
food, moped, and grew thin. One day, however,
a tiny, motherless kitten was given to
it. The gift turned out to be the dog's
salvation; it took
the greatest care of
the little creature,
and woe betide
the unfortunate
stranger who ventured
too near her
precious charge.

indebted to her
kindness for this
interesting photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward T.
Williams, of Tedworth
Square,
Chelsea, owns a
dove and a dog.
There is nothing very fresh in this item of

the dove on his head for more than a quarter
of a mile! They are the staunchest of friends,
and as soon
as the door of
the cage is
opened, out
hurries the
dove. It
searches for
the dog, if the
latter should
not already
happen to be
waiting for his
rider in the immediate neighbourhood, and the
dog seems to consider it as an absolute duty to
carry his friend about in this comical fashion.</p>

<p>Amongst other quaint and extraordinary
friendships between
animals of diverse species,
one of the most interesting
is that so frequently
struck up between cats
and horses. Pussie loves
to make a fragrant, hay-scented
stable her daily
lounge and to nestle
against the warm coat of
the horse, who often takes
his night's repose lying in
his stall with the favoured
Grimalkin snugly sleeping
between his iron-shod
hoofs. It was in Brook
Mews, N., that the animal
in question was "snapped"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
amidst the eager and
excited observations of
the many bystanders,
who quickly thronged
to see the fun.</p>

<p>The ladies who
have risen to such an
elevated position in
life are mother and
daughter. The sedate
matron is fully alive
to the importance of
the occasion, and has
adopted an easy, graceful
pose; while the
youngster, frisky and
somewhat shy, was with
difficulty persuaded to
settle comfortably
down. Mother cat is
an animal of very self-contained
and amiable
disposition. She has
contracted a fast friendship
with two white
rabbits belonging to
the coachman's little boy. They live in a
hutch in the stables, and are often allowed a
little liberty for a frolic with puss, who
chases them in and out of an empty stall.</p>

<p>From Covington, U.S.A., comes another
remarkable instance. Mr. E. E. Cone, of
that town, has a hen that displays a remarkably
perverted maternal instinct. One of
the neighbours has a cat with four small
kittens. The cat would be faithful to her
offspring were she not prevented by the
following circumstance. This particular hen
had been sitting for some time when
she suddenly conceived the idea that
the care of the kittens was more to her
liking. She, therefore, promptly drove the
mother cat away and took possession of the
kits. No hen-mother ever watched over her
brood with greater care than has this one over
her mewing, squirming litter of kittens. The
kittens offer no objection, and, with the exception
of the old cat, who looks on at a safe
distance, all is serene in this anomalous
family. In our photograph the hen is shown
endeavouring to cover the four kittens with
her wings, but it does not seem a very easy
task.</p>

</div>

<p>Extraordinary as this instance may seem,
we have in a way a parallel to it. We see a
cat taking under her charge some newly-born
chicks in much the same way as the mother-hen
did with the kittens. Mr. C. K. Eaton,
of Melbourne House,
Montpelier, Bristol, very
kindly sends us the photograph.</p>

<p>It appears that, through
some inexplicable reason
of her own, the mother of
the chicks deserted them
almost immediately after
being hatched, and consequently,
there being no
other means of rearing
them, they were for some
time kept in the kitchen,
where, after a few days,
they became fast friends
with puss, who proved a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
splendid substitute for the mother
hen. She seldom left them, and
when they were able to get about
she, for a long time, followed them
about the garden. The sight,
needless to add, was an extremely
pathetic one.</p>

little photo, of a guinea-pig with

pig is one of a pair, which Miss
Powell has trained in harness.
Brutus drags fair Venus about the
room in a miniature coach. They
are now being taught to sit in
loving companionship at a tea-table.
The rat is a tame one,
and is an adept at various clever
feats, in the imitation of
which the guinea-pigs are
nowhere.</p>

<p>And now for the strangest
instance in our collection.
This astonishing photograph
of a collie suckling a brood
of young foxes was taken
by Mr. Brown at a farm
near Lanark. The little
rascals were found in a den
not a hundred miles from
the farm. The farmer, with
due solicitude, secured the
little family, and took it to
his own fire-side. But what
could a respectable farmer do with a brood
of young foxes? Now, it happened that
only a day or two before this remarkable
find, a fine collie owned by the farmer
had become the happy mother of a family
of her own. The little collies were
speedily disposed of, and the young brood
of foxes given to the mother and left
to her kind solicitude. Wonderful to
relate, the dog took very kindly to them,
and actually suckled them for five or six
weeks.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I did</span> not sleep that night.
Next morning, I rose very
early from a restless bed with
a dry, hot mouth and a general
feeling that the solid earth had
failed beneath me.</p>

<p>Still no news from Harold! It was cruel,
I thought. My faith almost flagged. He
was a man and should be brave. How could
he run away and hide himself at such a
time? Even if I set my own anxiety aside,
just think to what serious misapprehension it
laid him open!</p>

<p>I sent out for the morning papers. They
were full of Harold. Rumours, rumours,
rumours! Mr. Tillington had deliberately
chosen to put himself in the wrong by disappearing
mysteriously at the last moment.
He had only himself to blame if the worst
interpretation were put upon his action.
But the police were on his track; Scotland
Yard had "a clue": it was confidently expected
an arrest would be made before
evening at latest. As to details, authorities
differed. The officials of the Great Western
Railway at Paddington were convinced that
Mr. Tillington had started, alone and undisguised,
by the night express for Exeter. The
South-Eastern inspectors at Charing Cross,
on the other hand, were equally certain that
he had slipped away with a false beard, in
company with "his accomplice," Higginson,
by the 8.15 p.m. to Paris. Everybody took
it for granted, however, that he had left
London.</p>

<p>Conjecture played with various ultimate
destinations&mdash;Spain, Morocco, Sicily, the
Argentine. In Italy, said the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, he
might lurk for a while&mdash;he spoke Italian
fluently, and could manage to put up at tiny
<em>osterie</em> in out-of-the-way places seldom visited
by Englishmen. He might try Albania,
said the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, airing its exclusive
"society" information: he had often hunted
there, and might in turn be hunted. He
would probably attempt to slink away to
some remote spot in the Carpathians or the
Balkans, said the <cite>Daily News</cite>, quite proud
of its geography. Still, wherever he went,
leaden-footed justice in this age, said the
<cite>Times</cite>, must surely overtake him. The day
of universal extradition had dawned; we
had no more Alsatias: even the Argentine
itself gives up its rogues&mdash;at last; not an
asylum for crime remains in Europe, not a
refuge in Asia, Africa, America, Australia,
or the Pacific Islands.</p>

<p>I noted with a shudder of horror that
all the papers alike took his guilt as certain.
In spite of a few decent pretences at not prejudging
an untried cause, they treated him
already as the detected criminal, the fugitive
from justice. I sat in my little sitting-room at
the hotel in Jermyn Street, a limp rag, looking
idly out of the window with swimming eyes,
and waiting for Lady Georgina. It was
early, too early, but&mdash;oh, why didn't she
come! Unless <em>somebody</em> soon sympathized
with me, my heart would break under this
load of loneliness!</p>

<p>Presently, as I looked out on the sloppy
morning street, I was vaguely aware
through the mist that floated before my
dry eyes (for tears were denied me) of a
very grand carriage driving up to the doorway&mdash;the
porch with the four wooden
Ionic pillars. I took no heed of it. I was
too heart-sick for observation. My life was
wrecked, and Harold's with it. Yet, dimly
through the mist, I became conscious after a
while that the carriage was that of an Indian
prince; I could see the black faces, the white
turbans, the gold brocades of the attendants
in the dickey. Then it came home to me
with a pang that this was the Maharajah.</p>

<p>It was kindly meant; yet after all that had
been insinuated in court the day before, I
was by no means over-pleased that his dusky
Highness should come to call upon me.
Walls have eyes and ears. Reporters were
hanging about all over London, eager to
distinguish themselves by successful eavesdropping.
They would note, with brisk
innuendoes after their kind, how "the
Maharajah of Moozuffernuggar called early
in the day on Miss Lois Cayley, with whom
he remained for at least half an hour in close
consultation." I had half a mind to send
down a message that I could not see him.
My face still burned with the undeserved
shame of the cross-eyed Q.C.'s unspeakable
suggestions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I could make my mind up, however,
I saw to my surprise that the Maharajah did
not propose to come in himself. He leaned
back in his place with his lordly Eastern air,
and waited, looking down on the gapers in
the street, while one of the two gorgeous
attendants in the dickey descended obsequiously
to receive his orders. The man was
dressed as usual in rich Oriental stuffs, and
wore his full white turban swathed in folds
round his head. I could not see his features.
He bent forward respectfully with Oriental
suppleness to take his Highness's orders.
Then, receiving a card and bowing low, he
entered the porch with the wooden Ionic
pillars, and disappeared within, while the
Maharajah folded his hands and seemed to
resign himself to a temporary Nirvana.</p>

<p>A minute later, a knock sounded on my
door. "Come in!" I said, faintly; and the
messenger entered.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image051.jpg" width="600" height="541" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE MESSENGER ENTERED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I turned and faced him. The blood
rushed to my cheek. "Harold!" I cried,
darting forward. My joy overcame me. He
folded me in his arms. I allowed him, unreproved.
For the first time he kissed me.
I did not shrink from it.</p>

<p>Then I stood away a little and gazed at
him. Even at that crucial moment of doubt
and fear, I could not help noticing how
admirably he made up as a handsome
young Rajput. Three years earlier, at
Schlangenbad, I remembered he had struck
me as strangely Oriental-looking: he had
the features of a high-born Indian gentleman,
without the complexion. His large,
poetical eyes, his regular, oval face, his
even teeth, his mouth and moustache,
all vaguely recalled the highest type of
the Eastern temperament. Now, he had
blackened his face and hands with some
permanent stain&mdash;Indian ink, I learned
later&mdash;and the resemblance to a Rajput
chief was positively startling. In his gold
brocade and ample white turban, no passer-by,
I felt sure, would ever have dreamt of
doubting him.</p>

<p>"Then you knew me at once?" he said,
holding my face between his hands.
"That's bad, darling! I flattered myself I
had transformed my face into the complete
Indian."</p>

<p>"Love has sharp eyes," I answered. "It
can see through brick walls. But the
disguise is perfect. No one else would
detect you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Love is blind, I thought."</p>

<p>"Not where it ought to see. There, it
pierces everything. I knew you instantly,
Harold. But all London, I am sure, would
pass you by, unknown. You are absolute
Orient."</p>

<p>"That's well; for all London is looking for
me," he answered, bitterly. "The streets
bristle with detectives. Southminster's
knaveries have won the day. So I have
tried this disguise. Otherwise, I should have
been arrested the moment the jury brought
in their verdict."</p>

<p>"And why were you not?" I asked, drawing
back. "Oh, Harold, I trust you; but
why did you disappear and make all the
world believe you admitted yourself guilty?"</p>

<p>He opened his arms. "Can't you guess?"
he cried, holding them out to me.</p>

<p>I nestled in them once more; but I
answered through my tears&mdash;I had found
tears now&mdash;"No, Harold; it baffles me."</p>

<p>"You remember what you promised me?"
he murmured, leaning over me and clasping
me. "If ever I were poor, friendless, hunted&mdash;you
would marry me. Now the opportunity
has come when we can both prove ourselves.
To-day, except you and dear Georgey, I
haven't a friend in the world. Everyone else
has turned against me. Southminster holds
the field. I am a suspected forger; in a
very few days I shall doubtless be a convicted
felon. Unjustly, as you know; yet
still&mdash;we must face it&mdash;a convicted felon. So
I have come to claim you. I have come to
ask you now, in this moment of despair, will
you keep your promise?"</p>

<p>I lifted my face to his. He bent over it
trembling. I whispered the words in his ear.
"Yes, Harold, I will keep it. I have always
loved you. And now I will marry you."</p>

<p>"I knew you would!" he cried, and
pressed me to his bosom.</p>

<p>We sat for some minutes, holding each
other's hands, and saying nothing; we
were too full of thought for words. Then
suddenly, Harold roused himself. "We must
make haste, darling," he cried. "We are
keeping Partab outside, and every minute is
precious, every minute's delay dangerous.
We ought to go down at once. Partab's
carriage is waiting at the door for us."</p>

<p>"Go down?" I exclaimed, clinging to
him. "How? Why? I don't understand.
What is your programme?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I forgot I hadn't explained to you!
Listen here, dearest&mdash;quick; I can waste no
words over it. I said just now I had no
friends in the world but you and Georgey.
That's not true, for dear old Partab has
stuck to me nobly. When all my English
friends fell away, the Rajput was true to me.
He arranged all this; it was his own idea;
he foresaw what was coming. He urged me
yesterday, just before the verdict (when he
saw my acquaintances beginning to look
askance), to slip quietly out of court, and
make my way by unobtrusive roads to his
house in Curzon Street. There, he darkened
my face like his, and converted me to
Hinduism. I don't suppose the disguise
will serve me for more than a day or two;
but it will last long enough for us to get
safely away to Scotland."</p>

<p>"Scotland?" I murmured. "Then you
mean to try a Scotch marriage?"</p>

<p>"It is the only thing possible. We must
be married to-day, and in England, of course,
we cannot do it. We would have to be
called in church, or else to procure a license,
either of which would involve disclosure of
my identity. Besides, even the license would
keep us waiting about for a day or two.
In Scotland, on the other hand, we can be
married at once. Partab's carriage is below,
to take you to Euston. He is staunch as
steel, dear fellow. Do you consent to go
with me?"</p>

<p>My faculty for promptly making up such
mind as I possess stood me once more in
good stead. "Implicitly," I answered.
"Dear Harold, this calamity has its happy
side&mdash;for without it, much as I love you,
I could never have brought myself to marry
you!"</p>

<p>"One moment," he cried. "Before you
go, recollect, this step is irrevocable. You
will marry a man who may be torn from you
this evening, and from whom fourteen years
of prison may separate you."</p>

<p>"I know it," I cried, through my tears.
"But&mdash;I shall be showing my confidence in
you, my love for you."</p>

<p>He kissed me once more, fervently.
"This makes amends for all," he cried.
"Lois, to have won such a woman as you, I
would go through it all a thousand times
over. It was for this, and for this alone,
that I hid myself last night. I wanted to
give you the chance of showing me how
much, how truly you loved me."</p>

<p>"And after we are married?" I asked,
trembling.</p>

<p>"I shall give myself up at once to the
police in Edinburgh."</p>

<p>I clung to him wistfully. My heart half
urged me to urge him to escape. But I
knew that was wrong. "Give yourself up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
then," I said, sobbing. "It is a brave man's
place. You must stand your trial: and, come
what will, I will strive to bear it with you."</p>

<p>"I knew you would," he cried. "I was
not mistaken in you."</p>

<p>We embraced again, just once. It was
little enough after those years of waiting.</p>

<p>"Now, come!" he cried. "Let us go."</p>

<p>I drew back. "Not with you, dearest,"
I whispered. "Not in the Maharajah's
carriage. You must start by yourself. I
will follow you at once, to Euston, in a
hansom."</p>

<p>He saw I was right. It would avoid
suspicion, and it would prevent more scandal.
He withdrew without a word. "We meet,"
I said, "at ten, at Euston."</p>

<p>I did not even wait to wash the tears from
my eyes. All red as they were, I put on my
hat and my little brown travelling jacket. I
don't think I so much as glanced once at the
glass. The seconds were precious. I saw
the Maharajah drive away, with Harold in
the dickey, arms crossed, imperturbable,
Orientally silent. He looked the very counterpart
of the Rajput by his side. Then I
descended the stairs and walked out boldly.
As I passed through the hall, the servants
and the visitors stared at me and whispered.
They spoke with nods and liftings of the
eyebrows. I was aware that that morning I
had achieved notoriety.</p>

<p>At Piccadilly Circus, I jumped of a
sudden into a passing hansom. "Euston!"
I cried, as I mounted the step. "Drive
quick! I have no time to spare." And, as
the man drove off, I saw, by a convulsive
dart of someone across the road, that I had
given the slip to a disappointed reporter.</p>

<p>At the station I took a first-class ticket
for Edinburgh. On the platform, the Maharajah
and his attendants were waiting. He
lifted his hat to me, though otherwise he
took no overt notice. But I saw his keen
eyes follow me down the train. Harold, in
his Oriental dress, pretended not to observe
me. One or two porters, and a few curious
travellers, cast inquiring eyes on the Eastern
prince, and made remarks about him to one
another. "That's the chap as was up yesterday
in the Ashurst will kise!" said one
lounger to his neighbour. But nobody
seemed to look at Harold; his subordinate
position secured him from curiosity. The
Maharajah had always two Eastern servants,
gorgeously dressed, in attendance; he had
been a well-known figure in London society,
and at Lord's and the Oval, for two or three
seasons.</p>

<p>"Bloomin' fine cricketer!" one porter
observed to his mate as he passed.</p>

<p>"Yuss; not so dusty for a nigger," the
other man replied. "Fust-rite bowler; but,
Lord, he can't 'old a candle to good old
Ranji."</p>

<p>As for myself, nobody seemed to recognise
me. I set this fact down to the fortunate
circumstance that the evening papers had
published rough wood-cuts which professed
to be my portrait, and which naturally
led the public to look out for a brazen-faced,
raw-boned, hard-featured termagant.</p>

<p>I took my seat in a ladies' compartment
by myself. As the train was about to start,
Harold strolled up as if casually for a
moment. "You think it better so?" he
queried, without moving his lips or seeming
to look at me.</p>

<p>"Decidedly," I answered. "Go back to
Partab. Don't come near me again till we
get to Edinburgh. It is dangerous still.
The police may at any moment hear we have
started and stop us half-way; and now that
we have once committed ourselves to this
plan, it would be fatal to be interrupted
before we have got married."</p>

<p>"You are right," he cried; "Lois, you are
always right, somehow."</p>

<p>I wished I could think so myself; but
'twas with serious misgivings that I felt the
train roll out of the station.</p>

<p>Oh, that long journey north, alone, in a
ladies' compartment&mdash;with the feeling that
Harold was so near, yet so unapproachable:
it was an endless agony. <em>He</em> had the
Maharajah, who loved and admired him, to
keep him from brooding; but I, left alone,
and confined with my own fears, conjured
up before my eyes every possible misfortune
that Heaven could send us. I saw clearly
now that if we failed in our purpose this
journey would be taken by everyone for a
flight, and would deepen the suspicion under
which we both laboured. It would make me
still more obviously a conspirator with Harold.</p>

<p>Whatever happened, we must strain every
nerve to reach Scotland in safety, and then
to get married, in order that Harold might
immediately surrender himself.</p>

<p>At York, I noticed with a thrill of terror
that a man in plain clothes, with the obtrusively
unobtrusive air of a detective, looked
carefully though casually into every carriage.
I felt sure he was a spy, because of his
marked outer jauntiness of demeanour, which
hardly masked an underlying hang-dog expression
of scrutiny. When he reached my
place, he took a long, careless stare at me&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>a
seemingly careless stare, which was yet
brim-full of the keenest observation. Then
he paced slowly along the line of carriages,
with a glance at each, till he arrived just
opposite the Maharajah's compartment.
There he stared hard once more. The
Maharajah descended; so did Harold and
the Hindu attendant, who was dressed
just like him. The man I took for a
detective indulged in a frank, long gaze at
the unconscious Indian prince, but cast only
a hasty eye on the two apparent followers.
That touch of revelation relieved my mind a
little. I felt convinced the police were
watching the Maharajah and myself, as suspicious
persons connected with the case; but
they had not yet guessed that Harold had
disguised himself as one of the two invariable
Rajput servants.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/image054.jpg" width="650" height="639" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE TOOK A LONG, CARELESS STARE AT ME."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We steamed on northward. At Newcastle,
the same detective strolled, with his hands in
his pockets, along the train once more,
and puffed a cigar with the nonchalant air
of a sporting gentleman. But I was certain
now, from the studious unconcern he was
anxious to exhibit, that he must be a spy
upon us. He overdid his mood of careless
observation. It was too obvious an assumption.
Precisely the same thing happened
again when we pulled up at Berwick. I
knew now that we were watched. It would
be impossible for us to get married at
Edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued.
There was but one chance open; we must
leave the train abruptly at the first Scotch
stopping station.</p>

<p>The detective knew we were booked
through for Edinburgh. So much I could
tell, because I saw him make inquiries of the
ticket examiner at York, and again at Berwick,
and because the ticket-examiner thereupon
entered a mental note of the fact as he
punched my ticket each time: "Oh, Edinburgh,
miss? All right"; and then stared at
me suspiciously. I could tell he had heard
of the Ashurst will case. He also lingered
long about the Maharajah's compartment,
and then went back to confer with the detective.
Thus, putting two and two together,
as a woman will, I came to the conclusion
that the spy did not expect us to leave the
train before we reached Edinburgh. That
told in our favour. Most men trust much to
just such vague expectations. They form a
theory, and then neglect the adverse chances.
You can only get the better of a skilled
detective by taking him thus, psychologically
and humanly.</p>

<p>By this time, I confess, I felt almost like
a criminal. Never in my life had danger
loomed so near&mdash;not even when we returned
with the Arabs from the oasis. For then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
we feared for our lives alone; now, we feared
for our honour.</p>

<p>I drew a card from my case before we
left Berwick station, and scribbled a few
hasty words on it in German. "We are
watched. A detective! If we run through
to Edinburgh, we shall doubtless be arrested
or at least impeded. This train will stop
at Dunbar for one minute. Just before it
leaves again, get out as quietly as you can&mdash;at
the last moment. I will also get out
and join you. Let Partab go on; it
will excite less attention.
The scheme I suggest
is the only safe plan.
If you agree, as soon
as we have well started
from Berwick, shake
your handkerchief unobtrusively
out of your
carriage window."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/image055.jpg" width="336" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I BECKONED A PORTER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>I beckoned a porter
noiselessly without one
word. The detective
was now strolling along
the fore-part of the
train, with his back
turned towards me, peering
as he went into all
the windows. I gave
the porter a shilling.
"Take this to a black
gentleman in the next
carriage but one," I
said, in a confidential
whisper. The porter
touched his hat, nodded,
smiled, and took it.</p>

<p>Would Harold see
the necessity for acting
on my advice?&mdash;I wondered.
I gazed out
along the train as soon
as we had got well clear
of Berwick. A minute&mdash;two
minutes&mdash;three
minutes passed; and
still no handkerchief. I began to despair.
He was debating, no doubt. If he refused,
all was lost, and we were disgraced for ever.</p>

<p>At last, after long waiting, as I stared still
along the whizzing line, with the smoke in
my eyes, and the dust half blinding me, I saw,
to my intense relief, a handkerchief flutter.
It fluttered once, not markedly, then a black
hand withdrew it. Only just in time, for
even as it disappeared, the detective's head
thrust itself out of a farther window. He
was not looking for anything in particular, as
far as I could tell&mdash;just observing the signals.
But it gave me a strange thrill to think even
now we were so nearly defeated.</p>

<p>My next trouble was&mdash;would the train
draw up at Dunbar? The 10 a.m. from
Euston is not set down to stop there in
Bradshaw, for no passengers are booked to
or from the station by the day express; but
I remembered from of old when I lived at
Edinburgh, that it used always to wait about
a minute for some engine-driver's purpose.
This doubt filled me with fresh fear; did it
draw up there still?&mdash;they
have accelerated
the service so much of
late years, and abolished
so many old accustomed
stoppages. I
counted the familiar
stations with my breath
held back. They seemed
so much farther apart
than usual. Reston&mdash;Grant's
House&mdash;Cockburnspath&mdash;Innerwick.</p>

<p>The next was Dunbar.
If we rolled past
<em>that</em>, then all was lost.
We could never get
married. I trembled
and hugged myself.</p>

<p>The engine screamed.
Did that mean she was
running through? Oh,
how I wished I had
learned the interpretation
of the signals!</p>

<p>Then gradually, gently,
we began to slow. Were
we slowing to pass the
station only? No; with
a jolt she drew up. My
heart gave a bound as I
read the word "Dunbar"
on the station
notice-board.</p>

<p>I rose and waited,
with my fingers on the door. Happily
it had one of those new-fashioned slip-latches
which open from inside. No need
to betray myself prematurely to the detective
by a hand displayed on the outer
handle. I glanced out at him cautiously.
His head was thrust through his window,
and his sloping shoulders revealed the
spy, but he was looking the other way&mdash;observing
the signals, doubtless, to discover
why we stopped at a place not mentioned in
Bradshaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Harold's face just showed from another
window close by. Too soon or too late
might either of them be fatal. He glanced
inquiry at me. I nodded back, "Now!"
The train gave its first jerk, a faint backward
jerk, indicative of the nascent intention of
starting. As it braced itself to go on, I
jumped out; so did Harold. We faced one
another on the platform without a word.
"Stand away there!" the station-master cried,
in an angry voice, and waved his white flag.
The detective, still absorbed on the signals,
never once looked back. One second later,
we were safe at Dunbar, and he was speeding
away by the express for Edinburgh!</p>

<p>It gave us a breathing space of about an
hour.</p>

<p>For half a minute I could not speak. My
heart was in my mouth. I hardly even dared
to look at Harold. Then the station-master
stalked up to us with a threatening manner.
"You can't get out here," he said, crustily, in
a gruff Scotch voice. "This train is not
timed to set down before Edinburgh."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image056.jpg" width="700" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'YOU CAN'T GET OUT HERE,' HE SAID, CRUSTILY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"We <em>have</em> got out," I answered, taking it
upon me to speak for my fellow-culprit, the
Hindu&mdash;as he was to all seeming. "The
logic of facts is with us. We were booked
through to Edinburgh, but we wanted to stop
at Dunbar; and as the train happened to
pull up, we thought we needn't waste time by
going on all that way and then coming back
again."</p>

<p>"Ye should have changed at Berwick,"
the station-master said, still gruffly, "and
come on by the slow train." I could see
his careful Scotch soul was vexed (incidentally)
at our extravagance in paying
the extra fare to Edinburgh and back
again.</p>

<p>In spite of agitation, I managed to summon
up one of my sweetest smiles&mdash;a smile that
ere now had melted the hearts of rickshaw
coolies and of French <em>douaniers</em>. He thawed
before it visibly. "Time was important to
us," I said&mdash;oh, he guessed not how important;
"and besides, you know, it is so
good for the company!"</p>

<p>"That's true," he answered, mollified. He
could not tilt against the interests of the
North British shareholders. "But how about
yer luggage? It'll have gone on to Edinburgh,
I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"We <em>have</em> no luggage," I answered, boldly.</p>

<p>He stared at us both, puckered his brow a
moment, and then burst out laughing. "Oh,
ay, I see," he answered, with a comic air of
amusement. "Well, well, it's none of <em>my</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
business, no doubt, and I will not interfere
with ye; though why a lady like you&mdash;&mdash;"
He glanced curiously at Harold.</p>

<p>I saw he had guessed right, and thought it
best to throw myself unreservedly on his
mercy. Time was indeed important. I
glanced at the station clock. It was not
very far from the stroke of six, and we must
manage to get married before the detective
could miss us at Edinburgh, where he was
due at 6.30.</p>

<p>So I smiled once more, that heart-softening
smile. "We have each our own fancies,"
I said, blushing&mdash;and, indeed (such is the
pride of race among women), I felt myself
blush in earnest at the bare idea that I was
marrying a black man, in spite of our good
Maharajah's kindness. "He is a gentleman,
and a man of education and culture." I
thought that recommendation ought to tell
with a Scotchman. "We are in sore straits
now, but our case is a just one. Can you tell
me who in this place is most likely to
sympathize&mdash;most likely to marry us?"</p>

<p>He looked at me&mdash;and surrendered at
discretion. "I should think anybody would
marry ye who saw yer pretty face and heard
yer sweet voice," he answered. "But, perhaps,
ye'd better present yerself to Mr. Schoolcraft,
the U.P. minister at Little Kirkton. He
was ay soft-hearted."</p>

<p>"How far from here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About two miles," he answered.</p>

<p>"Can we get a trap?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ay, there's machines always waiting
at the station."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image057.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WE TOLD OUR TALE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We interviewed a "machine," and drove
out to Little Kirkton. There, we told our
tale in the fewest words possible to the
obliging and good-natured U.P. minister.
He looked, as the station-master had said,
"soft-hearted"; but he dashed our hopes to
the ground at once by telling us candidly
that unless we had had our residence in
Scotland for twenty-one days immediately
preceding the marriage, it would not be legal.
"If you were Scotch," he added, "I could
go through the ceremony at once, of course;
and then you could apply to the sheriff to-night
for leave to register the marriage in
proper form afterward: but as one of you is
English, and the other I judge"&mdash;he smiled
and glanced towards Harold&mdash;"an Indian-born
subject of Her Majesty, it would be
impossible for me to do it: the ceremony
would be invalid, under Lord Brougham's
Act, without previous residence."</p>

<p>This was a terrible blow. I looked away
appealingly. "Harold," I cried in despair,
"do you think we could manage to hide ourselves
safely anywhere in Scotland for twenty-one
days?"</p>

<p>His face fell. "How could I escape
notice? All the world is hunting for me.
And then, the scandal! No matter where
you stopped&mdash;however far from me&mdash;no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Lois, darling, I could never expose you
to it."</p>

<p>The minister glanced from one to the
other of us, puzzled. "Harold?" he said,
turning over the word on his tongue.
"Harold? That doesn't sound like an
Indian name, does it? And&mdash;&mdash;" he
hesitated, "you speak wonderful English!"</p>

<p>I saw the safest plan was to make a clean
breast of it. He looked the sort of man one
could trust on an emergency. "You have
heard of the Ashurst will case?" I said,
blurting it out suddenly.</p>

<p>"I have seen something about it in the
newspapers; yes. But it did not interest
me: I have not followed it."</p>

<p>I told him the whole truth; the case
against us&mdash;the facts as we knew them.
Then I added, slowly, "This is Mr. Harold
Tillington, whom they accuse of forgery.
Does he look like a forger? I want to
marry him before he is tried. It is the only
way by which I can prove my implicit trust
in him. As soon as we are married, he will
give himself up at once to the police&mdash;if you
wish it, before your eyes. But married we
must be. <em>Can't</em> you manage it somehow?"</p>

<p>My pleading voice touched him. "Harold
Tillington?" he murmured. "I know of his
forebears. Lady Guinevere Tillington's son,
is it not? Then you must be Younger of
Gledcliffe." For Scotland is a village: everyone
in it seems to have heard of every other.</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" I asked. "Younger
of Gledcliffe?" I remembered now that
the phrase had occurred in Mr. Ashurst's will,
though I never understood it.</p>

<p>"A Scotch fashion," Harold answered.
"The heir to a laird is called Younger of so-and-so.
My father has a small estate of that
name in Dumfriesshire; a <em>very</em> small estate:
I was born and brought up there."</p>

<p>"Then you are a Scotchman?" the
minister asked.</p>

<p>"I have never counted myself so," Harold
answered, frankly: "except by remote descent.
We are trebly of the female line at Gledcliffe;
still, I am no doubt more or less Scotch by
domicile."</p>

<p>"Younger of Gledcliffe! Oh, yes, that
ought certainly to be quite sufficient for our
purpose. But then&mdash;the lady?"</p>

<p>"She is unmitigatedly English," Harold
admitted, in a gloomy voice.</p>

<p>"Not quite," I answered. "I lived four
years in Edinburgh. And I spent my
holidays there while I was at Girton. I keep
my boxes still at my old rooms in Maitland
Street."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will do," the minister answered,
quite relieved; for it was clear that our
anxiety and the touch of romance in our tale
had enlisted him in our favour. "Indeed,
now I come to think of it, it suffices
for the Act if one only of the parties is
domiciled in Scotland. Still, I can do nothing
save marry you now by religious service in
the presence of my servants&mdash;which constitutes
what we call an ecclesiastical marriage&mdash;it
becomes legal if afterwards registered;
and then you must apply to the sheriff for a
warrant to register it. But I will do what I
can; later on, if you like, you can be remarried
by the rites of your own Church in
England."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure our Scotch domicile
is good enough in law?" Harold asked, still
doubtful.</p>

<p>"I can turn it up, if you wish. I have a
legal hand-book. Before Lord Brougham's
Act, no formalities were necessary. But the
Act was passed to prevent Gretna Green
marriages. The usual phrase is that such a
marriage does not hold good unless one or
other of the parties either has had his or her
usual residence in Scotland, or else has lived
there for twenty-one days immediately preceding
the date of the marriage. If you
like, I will wait to consult the authorities."</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I cried. "There is no
time to lose. Marry us first, and look it up
afterwards. 'One or other' will do, it seems.
Mr. Tillington is Scotch enough, I am sure;
we will rest our claim upon that. Even if
the marriage turns out invalid, we only
remain where we were. This is a preliminary
ceremony to prove good faith, and to bind us
to one another. We can satisfy the law, if
need be, when we return to England."</p>

<p>The minister called in his wife and servants,
and explained to them briefly. He exhorted
us and prayed. We gave our solemn consent
in legal form before five witnesses. Then he
pronounced us duly married. In a quarter
of an hour more, we had made declaration to
that effect before the sheriff, and were formally
affirmed to be man and wife before the
law of Great Britain. I asked if it would
hold in England as well.</p>

<p>"You couldn't be firmer married," the
sheriff said, with decision, "by the Archbishop
of Canterbury in Westminster Abbey."</p>

<p>Harold turned to the minister. "Will
you send for the police?" he said, calmly.
"I wish to inform them that I am the man
for whom they are looking in the Ashurst
will case."</p>

<p>Our own cabman went to fetch them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
was a terrible moment. But Harold sat in
the sheriffs study and waited, as if nothing
unusual were happening. He talked freely
but quietly. Never in my life had I felt so
proud of him.</p>

<p>At last the police came, much inflated with
the dignity of so great a capture, and took
down our statement. "Do you give yourself
in charge on a confession of forgery?" the
superintendent asked, as Harold ended.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Harold answered. "I
have not committed forgery. But I do not
wish to skulk or hide myself. I understand
a warrant is out against me in London. I
have come to Scotland, hurriedly, for the
sake of getting married, not to escape apprehension.
I am here, openly, under my own
name. I tell you the facts; 'tis for you to
decide: if you choose, you can arrest me."</p>

<p>The superintendent conferred for some
time in another room with the sheriff. Then
he returned to the study. "Very well, sir,"
he said, in a respectful tone, "I arrest you."</p>

<p>So that was the beginning of our married
life. More than ever,
I felt sure I could
trust in Harold.</p>

<p>The police decided,
after hearing by telegram
from London,
that we must go up
at once by the night
express, which they
stopped for the purpose.
They were
forced to divide us.
I took the sleeping
car; Harold travelled
with two constables in an ordinary carriage.
Strange to say, notwithstanding all this, so
great was our relief from the tension of our
flight, that we both slept soundly.</p>

<p>Next morning we arrived in London,
Harold guarded. The police had arranged
that the case should come up at Bow Street
that afternoon. It was not an ideal honeymoon,
and yet, I was somehow happy.</p>

<p>At Euston, they took him away from me.
And still, I hardly cried. All the way up in
the train, whenever I was awake, an idea had
been haunting me&mdash;a possible clue to this
trickery of Lord Southminster's. Petty
details cropped up and fell into their places.
I began to unravel it all now. I had an
inkling of a plan to set Harold right again.</p>

<p>The will we had proved&mdash;&mdash;but I must not
anticipate.</p>

<p>When we parted, Harold kissed me on the
forehead, and murmured rather sadly, "Now
I suppose it's all up. Lois, I must go.
These rogues have been too much for us."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"I HAVE FOUND A CLUE."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I answered, new hope
growing stronger and
stronger within me.
"I see a way out.
I have found a clue.
I believe, dear
Harold, the right
will still be vindicated."</p>

<p>And red-eyed as
I was, I jumped into
a hansom, and called
to the cabman to
drive at once to Lady
Georgina's.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Alfred I. Burkholder.</span></p>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image060-1.jpg" height="255" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Logs</span> belonging to various individuals
and firms in the
lumber industry of the
North Western United
States are identified and
separated in a striking
fashion. To illustrate
this it will be necessary
to outline briefly
the routine of work
connected with the great lumbering industry
of the regions mentioned. Logging camps
are established in the heart of a forest.
Where no railroads have been extended to
the vicinity of the camps, roads are cut to the
nearest river, which is the highway by which
the logs are taken in the spring to saw-mills,
where they are manufactured into shingles,
lath, boards, timbers, and planks. Therefore,
proximity to a river is necessarily taken into
consideration when a camp is located.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image060-2.jpg" width="362" height="210" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the trees are sawed down by men
engaged especially for this duty, they are
sawed into log lengths and
hauled, perhaps several
miles, to the bank of the
river. Some of the camps
contain as many as 300 or
400 men, and this force is
kept busy during the entire
winter cutting down trees,
sawing them into logs, and
hauling them to the river. Here they are
placed in huge piles, and it is at this time
that the log-mark of the owner is placed upon
them by an individual known as the "scaler,"
whose duty it also is to measure the diameter
of each log and keep a record of it.</p>

<p>In this article we show a few of these
curious log-marks&mdash;odd artistic inventions of
the untrained minds of the lumber-camps.
There is no attempt at uniformity in ideas.
Anything that has the least bit of distinctiveness
about it is sufficient for the
purpose, which explains the presence of
pound-marks, tea-pots, frogs, babies, yokes,
division signs, and wheel-barrows in the
illustrations for this article.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/image060-3.jpg" width="299" height="240" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The instrument with which
the "scaler" places the mark
upon a log is in the shape of a
sledge-hammer, the back of the
hammer portion having upon
it a device similar to the log-mark
of the man by whom
he is employed and to whom
the logs belong. The log-mark
itself is raised to a height of about
1&frac12;in. or 2in. above the surrounding surface
of steel, and when the sawed end of a log is
struck with it, the mark of the owner is
punched into the end of the log to a depth
which prevents its obliteration, unless the
whole end of the log is sawed off and
removed. Crude designs, differing from
the regular log-mark, are sometimes cut
into the bark of the log to assist in
more readily identifying the owner. Copies
of log-marks and cattle-brands are, as provided
by law, placed on a file in the office of
the county recorder of deeds in the county
in which the cattle owner or lumberman
operates.</p>

<p>For greater convenience the ice in the river
is thickly covered with the logs as spring
approaches. When the break-up of ice in
the river occurs, and the stream is swollen by
the melting of snow and the early spring
rains, what is called the log "drive" commences.
In some portions of the lumbering
regions the disappearance of
the forests has left the saw-mills
further and further
from the product without
which they cannot operate,
and the logs have to be
floated great distances.
Thus, a "drive" of 100 or
200 miles is nothing unusual,
and on the Mississippi river logs are
frequently taken as much as 300 miles.</p>

<p>On one river perhaps a dozen or more
lumbering firms, having no connection with
each other, are operating, and when spring
comes all their logs are rolled into the
stream, to soon become so mixed up that
the novice naturally becomes of the opinion
that their separation is an impossibility. The
work during a log "drive" is the hardest
and most dangerous connected with the
lumbering industry.</p>

<p>The men are required to be up long before
daylight, so that they may eat their breakfasts
and walk to the river, perhaps several
miles distant, arriving there at
daylight to begin the work of
the day. Refreshments are
taken to them twice during
the day, at about ten o'clock
in the forenoon, and again at
two o'clock in the afternoon.
They work until it becomes
dark, when they walk back
to their camps to procure their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
suppers and much-needed rest. The log
drivers are required to keep the logs floating
in the streams. In rainy or cold weather,
such as is frequently experienced in the
lumbering regions, their work is very arduous
and debilitating. It is of the utmost importance
that the work of floating
the logs out be pushed
while there is sufficient water
in the streams, many of which
become nothing more than
creeks later in the season, when
dry weather sets in.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/image061-1.jpg" width="269" height="287" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The force of the current behind
the huge mass of logs may
force hundreds of logs to a
lodgment on the bank when
curves in the stream are reached,
and then the men are compelled to work,
perhaps waist deep, in the water in order to
clear the stranded logs and once more
get them afloat. The foremost logs are
especially looked after and kept on the
move, for should they become lodged the
obstruction thus formed would speedily
cause a log "jam," the thing particularly to
be dreaded by the
drivers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/image061-2.jpg" width="252" height="232" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding
the extreme care and
precautions, jams
occasionally occur.
Then the logs are
piled high in the
air, the weight of
the mass sinking the
logs to the bottom of the river, and extending
from bank to bank of the stream, forming
an almost solid wedge, which constantly
becomes larger and more compact. It is
nothing unusual for the logs to be piled to
a height of 100ft. or 150ft., and extending
for several miles up the river.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/image061-3.jpg" width="217" height="309" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A jam in the St. Croix river, in Wisconsin
and Minnesota, in the spring
of 1892, was about six miles
in length. Another one that
formed in the Chippewa
river, in the former State, in
1886, extended ten miles.
This river was also the scene,
twenty years ago, of perhaps
the greatest log jam in
history. It extended for a distance of
twenty-five miles, and was estimated to
contain over 150,000,000ft. of lumber.</p>

<p>It sometimes requires several days' hard
labour to "break" a jam. Not infrequently
a single log may be the cause of the whole
difficulty, and the removal of this "key" log
is naturally a dangerous duty. It may be
lodged so tightly by the great mass of logs
wedged against it by the swift current of the
river, that its removal is accomplished only
after chopping it in two with an axe. The man
who does this takes his life in
his hands, for the removal of
the "key" log almost instantly
releases the towering mass of
logs behind it and the greatest
agility is required by the daring
man to reach a place of safety
ere the released mass goes
churning onward, forced to
almost lightning speed by the
irresistible power behind it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/image061-4.jpg" width="342" height="199" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The log drivers wear heavy
boots, from the soles of which project
sharpened steel or iron spikes, placed
thickly. With these, it in time becomes
an easy matter for the men to run about
on the floating and twisting logs with as
much confidence as that exhibited by the
dweller in a city when
striding along a pavement.
Accidents, however,
occasionally happen,
and some of the
men are precipitated
into the water. Where
an experienced hand
loses his balance and
falls into the water he
immediately becomes
an object of ridicule,
and is severely bantered
by his comrades. The involuntary bath
of a new hand is taken as a matter of course,
and occasions no particular comment.</p>

<p>The men become surprisingly expert at
log "riding," as it is termed. A remarkable
instance of this expertness was
witnessed by a writer while visiting the
lumber region on the Ottawa
and tributary rivers, in
Canada. He was sitting in
his tent one evening on the
west bank of the River des
Quinze, near the head of
Lake Temiscamingue, when
he heard a young Frenchman
on the opposite side of
stream call for a boat to come over
him across. At the time, a great
many logs were floating down the river, the
current carrying them close to the shore a
short distance above the point where the
young Frenchman stood, and then sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
them diagonally across
the stream close to the
shore nearly in front of
the tent of the observer.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/image062-1.jpg" width="433" height="197" alt="" />
</div>

<p>No boat answering
his hail, the Frenchman
walked up the shore
to where the logs were
pressing it most closely, and, watching
his opportunity, jumped upon one. With
his hands in his pockets he unconcernedly
waited for his improvised ferry to take him
to the opposite shore. In midstream the logs
were carried through a rapid. Here the log
upon which the young man was standing
began to revolve rapidly in the swift current,
but he speedily checked the dangerous movement
by forcing it to revolve in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>During the strange journey across the
river, which at that point was fully 200yds.
wide, he never for a moment lost his balance,
and all the time was whistling cheerily,
apparently wholly oblivious of the danger.
When the log upon which he stood was
swept across the river and
close to the opposite shore,
he calmly leaped to the bank.
He could not swim, which,
strange to relate, is the case
with fully one-half of the
men engaged in the dangerous
work of log driving.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/image062-2.jpg" width="354" height="177" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I am told by a gentleman familiar with the
scenes and incidents connected with log
driving, that he has frequently seen the
drivers cross rivers which were comparatively
free of logs, by standing upon a log and
with their feet making it revolve quite swiftly,
and thus gradually propelling it across the
stream. Perhaps it was by observing this
operation that the inventor conceived the
idea of a roller boat, with which experiments
have been made on the Atlantic.</p>

<p>When the logs have reached their destination
the utility of the log-marks is apparent.
When the great mass of logs have been
floated to the vicinity of the saw-mills which
will manufacture them into lumber, they are
brought to a standstill, and preparations are
made to separate the
logs belonging to different
owners. Long
"booms" are constructed
up and down
the river a short
distance below the head
of the drive of logs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/image062-3.jpg" width="478" height="202" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Logs placed end to
end, and securely
fastened together, form
the "booms." The
upper end is chained
to piers or other immovable
objects, which are stout enough to
hold the string of logs forming the booms.
A river is divided off into a sufficient number
of "booms" to provide a separate boom for
each firm or individual having logs in the
"drive." A strong rope is then stretched
across the river a short distance above the
ends of the booms. This swings only a few
feet above the river, and is for the convenience
of the men who separate the logs
and float them into the proper boom.</p>

<p>The space between the shore and the
first boom is exclusively for logs belonging
to a certain firm or individual; the space
between the first and second booms for
those of another, and so on. As the logs
are floated down from the stationary "drive"
above, which, perhaps, fills
the river from bank to bank,
and extends up the stream
as far as the eye can reach,
the men whose duty it is to
separate the logs catch them
as fast as they are floated
down to them, hastily glance
at the log-mark, mount the log, and, with
the aid of the rope stretched from bank to
bank, pull themselves and the log to a point
directly above the boom of the owner of the
log, and then release it, and permit it to be
carried by the current into the proper boom.</p>

<p>With the aid of pike-poles and other appliances,
each man can take care of a number
of logs at one time, thus simplifying and
expediting the work of separating the logs.
As many men as can work without being in
each other's way are stationed immediately
above the booms, and separate the logs with
astonishing accuracy and rapidity.</p>

<p>The log-marks, as in the case of cattle-brands,
reduce the theft of logs to the
minimum, as the tell-tale mark, if overlooked
and not removed, is
a silent though convincing
witness against
anyone who steals it
and in whose possession
it is found.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By M. Dinorben Griffith and Madame Camille Flammarion.</span></p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-o.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once</span> or twice one has come
across a story of some adventurous
couple (usually in
America) who have been
married in a captive balloon.
The incident is reproduced
from time to time, the newspapers printing
it almost always placing on some other newspaper
the responsibility of the statement.
The story may originally have taken its birth
in a diseased craving of some undistinguished
couple for notoriety, or, as is more likely, in
a lack of striking headlines for some very
enterprising American paper. But in any
case, we are concerned here with no such
matter, but with an actual wedding trip,
undertaken and carried through by a very
distinguished couple, in a perfectly free
balloon; and this with no idea of notoriety-hunting.</p>

<p>The name of M. Camille Flammarion, the
distinguished French astronomer, is very
nearly as familiar in this country as in
France, and some of his most important
works are made popular by means of translations.
He is distinguished by an imagination
very rare in men of science, and his
theories of the inhabitation of the stars are of
a very striking and beautiful character; while
many other of his astronomical speculations
are similarly bold and original.</p>

<p>M. Flammarion's interest in ballooning
began more than thirty years ago, and since
that time he has been a most enthusiastic
aeronaut; making very numerous ascents and
recording large numbers of extremely important
scientific observations. His book,
"Voyages en Ballon," contains many interesting
accounts of his ascents, and has been
translated by Mr. James Glaisher, the English
meteorologist and aeronaut. It is of the
wedding trip performed in a balloon by
Monsieur and Madame Flammarion that we
are to speak.</p>

<p>Madame Flammarion is herself a most
enthusiastic balloon-traveller. Indeed, she
has often said that nothing but the practical
impossibility of the feat prevents her living
altogether in a balloon. And she takes much
delight in recounting the story of her wedding
trip, which was her first balloon ascent, and
of a humorous incident which characterized it.
We shall give Madame Flammarion's account
as nearly as her own words can be rendered
in English. The story was told us in the
beautiful garden of the Ch&acirc;teau Juvisy, the
magnificent house which is now M. Flammarion's
home and observatory, but which
has been the resting-place of French Kings
in their journeys between Paris and Fontainebleau,
from Henri Quatre to Louis Philippe.
Parenthetically we may say that Madame
Flammarion is herself a distinguished person,
and Vice-President of the League of Ladies
on behalf of International Disarmament.
This is her story as she tells it:&mdash;</p>

<p>I had always wished to make a balloon
ascent. The stories and descriptions I had
read had touched my enthusiasm, and already,
before I had entered a balloon, I was, at
heart, an enthusiastic aeronaut. To hang in
space above, looking down upon the rolling
world below, and all the little people in it,
was for years the height of all my ambitions.
Nevertheless, I never expected to make an
ascent in circumstances so novel and charming
as those which actually accompanied my
first balloon experience.</p>

<p>Just before our marriage, in discussing with
my future husband the form which our
wedding journey should take, I begged him
to choose the most magnificent and poetical
route possible&mdash;an ideal route, never before
made use of in the like circumstances.
M. Flammarion understood my meaning
at once. Indeed, the same thought had
occurred to himself, though I first gave it
expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>From this moment Flammarion was busily
engaged with the aeronaut, M. Jules Godard,
in making preparations for the aerial journey.
But preparations for the wedding itself also
claimed attention, and it was in some part in
consequence of Flammarion's
desires in this
matter that an odd incident
made memorable the first
part of our journey.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">

<div class="caption"><p>M. FLAMMARION (AT THE TIME OF THE
WEDDING).
<cite>From a Photo. by Alexander Martin, Paris.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>First we were married in
legal form&mdash;in a manner
corresponding to marriage
before a registrar in England.
Flammarion wished
this to be the only ceremony,
and desired no Church rite;
in this being consistent with
his great astronomical philosophy,
which I expect to be
the religion of the future.
But in the end he waived
his determination, to please
our mothers&mdash;and, I must
confess, to please me also.
But he made the condition
that there should be no confession,
such as is usually
made part of the Roman
Catholic ceremony. The
good Abb&eacute; P&mdash;&mdash;, who was to officiate, expended
all his eloquence to shake Flammarion's
determination in this respect, but his
eloquence and his pains went
for nothing. It was useless
to insist, Flammarion assured
him, and he found it so.</p>

<p>"But, my dear friend,"
pleaded the excellent Abb&eacute;,
"if not a confession, then at
least something: merely a
conversation."</p>

<p>"No! Never! Not even
that!" was Flammarion's
final answer.</p>

<p>"Then," persisted the
Abb&eacute;, "you will at any rate
grant me one personal
favour&mdash;nothing connected
with the ceremony. Say,
now, will you grant me that
favour?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," Flammarion
replied, rather incautiously.
"Granted
before asked. What is it?"</p>

<p>"That I may ascend with you in the
balloon."</p>

<p>"Abb&eacute;&mdash;you are a shrewd man. It shall
be as you wish, of course. In fact, the
balloon will carry four, and as we ourselves,
with the aeronaut, M. Godard, make only
three, there is a vacancy. You shall fill it,
Monsieur l'Abb&eacute;&mdash;it is promised."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the outcome
of this promise was
very deep offence to a very
worthy man&mdash;so deep, that
the Abb&eacute; was almost
estranged from my husband,
as you shall hear.</p>

<p>Every detail of the events
of our wedding-day is as
clearly defined in my memory
as if it were but a recollection
of yesterday. It was a
brilliant day, and all the
town seemed as gay and as
happy as we. Still, there
was one little matter of
regret&mdash;our balloon trip
must be postponed for a
little while, for M. Jules
Godard had had an apoplectic
fit three days before,
and was not yet recovered.
This the Abb&eacute; did not know.</p>

<p>The service, which was
short, had finished, and we
were in our carriage&mdash;indeed, Flammarion
was in the act of closing the door&mdash;when a
vigorous hand seized the bridegroom's and a
joyous voice cried, "And I
also?"</p>

<p>It was the Abb&eacute;. In the
confusion of our happiness
we had quite forgotten that
he was to accompany us to
the breakfast&mdash;to which, as
a matter of fact, he had been
the first person invited.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; entered the
carriage with no more ceremony,
installed himself comfortably,
and carefully
deposited a travelling bag
on the seat before him.</p>

</div>

<p>"Hey! hey!" quoth the
Abb&eacute;", laughing merrily and
rubbing his hands together.
"Here we are, my friends!
Well! We set out this
evening in our balloon,
don't we? Eh? I have
prepared&mdash;O yes, I have
prepared! I shall send messages to all my
friends. I have filled this bag with little
papers, on each of which I have written:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
'From the altitude of the heavens I salute
you. Abb&eacute; P&mdash;&mdash;.' These we will throw out
from the balloon!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Abb&eacute;," said Flammarion,
a little taken aback; "we haven't told you.
We're not going now!"</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; grew almost livid. "Come!"
he stammered. "What&mdash;what's this? Is it
a joke? Anyhow, it isn't a good one!"</p>

<p>"I assure you, my dear Abb&eacute;, it is no
joke, but the simple truth. We <em>can't</em> go, for
Godard the aeronaut is ill. Three days ago
he had an apoplectic fit&mdash;indeed, he very
nearly died. What should we have done if
the fit had occurred in the balloon? He is
better now, but not well enough to make
the ascent."</p>

<p>The poor Abb&eacute; was thunderstruck. "And
I was so counting on the journey!" he said.
"I've been telling everybody I know! People
have even been sending me provisions for
the voyage. Truly, I don't know where we
should have put them; but that's beside the
question&mdash;they came. And now we are
not to go! I shall be the laughing-stock
of all my acquaintance! It's too bad&mdash;too
bad!"</p>

<p>All through the breakfast the Abb&eacute; remained
melancholy, notwithstanding the
merry occasion, and the fact that Madame
Godard, who was present, assured him that
her husband was quite unable to make an
ascent in his weakly condition. Till at last,
in parting from him, Flammarion cheered
him by the assurance that he <em>should</em> go up in
a balloon after all, for, in fact, the project was
only deferred. And so the Abb&eacute; departed
hopefully. But who can count on the
future? Fate disposed things differently, and
poor Abb&eacute; P&mdash;&mdash;'s misfortune endured to the
end of the matter.</p>

<p>At last the time arrived, a week after the
wedding-day. On the eve of the day fixed
for the ascent my brother-in-law&mdash;Ernest
Flammarion, the publisher&mdash;came to see us.
He also wished to ascend with us; was most
eager, in fact. It must be remembered that,
at the time I speak of, balloon ascents were
much less common than they have since
become, and one had very few opportunities
of an experience in the air. In the end, my
husband promised his brother that he should
come, if only the Abb&eacute; should be prevented,
or should from any cause forego his claim.
Ernest quite understood the situation, and
waited with much anxiety, but with little
hope. "It's not of much use," he said.
"The Abb&eacute; won't give up his place. I'm
afraid the thing's settled!"</p>

<p>The few hours intervening before the time
fixed for the start were hours of anxious
watching. The weather was perfect, but we
were constantly on thorns lest some change
should manifest itself.</p>

<p>But what of the Abb&eacute;? When the start
was determined upon&mdash;on the morning of
the day when Ernest Flammarion called on
us&mdash;my husband hurried out to inform the
Abb&eacute;, but found that he was away from
home, at La Varenne Saint-Hilaire, which he
always made his summer residence. Still,
the Abb&eacute;'s servant assured Flammarion that
he would be back, doubtless in the evening.
So a note was written and left on the Abb&eacute;'s
desk, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We set out to-morrow at close of day
in a balloon; do not miss this celestial
appointment, but meet us at about five
o'clock at the gas-works of La Villette.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Flammarion.</span>"</p>

<p>The eventful day (it was the 28th of
August, 1874) dawned brilliantly, and the
day fulfilled the promise of the dawn&mdash;a
delightfully equable temperature, a gentle
breeze, and a bright sky. And at five we
assembled at the gas-works&mdash;our aeronaut
and his wife, my brother-in-law, Ernest
Flammarion, and ourselves, with a number
of friends to see us off.</p>

<p>It is necessary to allow plenty of time for
preparations in view of a balloon ascent,
because of the innumerable details to be
attended to, any one of which may delay the
start for an unexpected length of time. One
may allow an hour as ample, and then, at
the end of three hours, find the balloon
still unready. No such delay occurred in
this case, though Godard and his assistants
were hard at work for some time, while we
talked with our friends.</p>

<p>The balloon, which rolled and swung
before us, had been specially made for us,
and it was of 2,000 m&egrave;tres cubic capacity.
Its material was the best China silk, and it
had a magnificent dark golden tint, most
beautiful as it rose, semi-transparent in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>In vain we awaited the Abb&eacute;. We
wondered whether anything could have prevented
his receiving the note, or whether he
might be ill. It would soon be impossible
to wait longer. The balloon trembled, and
the great globe rose, little by little, from the
ground. Soon it was a truly beautiful object,
immense in its rotundity and majestic as it
rose above us, vibrating with the powerful
breath that soon was to lift us up into the
unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything was prepared, and still there
was no sign of Abb&eacute; P&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"Plainly the Abb&eacute; is not coming," said
Godard. "We can wait no longer. We
must start at once if we are to see Paris at
sunset!"</p>

<p>"Then we will go," said my husband.
And scarce had he turned to speak to his
brother when the latter was in the car beside
the aeronaut. Indeed, he scarce seemed
certain of his good fortune till he was well
in the air.</p>

<p>Now it was my turn. The car was a little
way from the ground, so my husband carried
me. I was trembling with excitement and
impatience. In
another minute,
when all four were
in their places,
Godard cried, "Let
go, all!" and our
friends about the
car fell back
quickly.</p>

<p>For me, I confess,
it was a serious
moment. I could
not resist speculations
as to where
we were going, into
what tempestuous
whirlwind we might
be carried, what
lightning-cloud
might rend and
burn our balloon,
now so gallant and
so beautiful.</p>

<p>We rose, at first,
softly and slowly.
For a long time
we could hear the
voices below us,
"<em>Au revoir!</em> A
good voyage and a
quick return!" But
with our release from the earth we were no
longer the same: we seemed to leave all
earthly interests behind us. Our bodily
weight we seemed to lose, and our brains
also grew buoyant. We were held entirely
by admiration of the wonders about us.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/image066.jpg" width="542" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"AU REVOIR!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nothing so magnificent had I ever
imagined. The charming landscapes of the
earth were small things indeed in comparison
with the colossal, the marvellous prospect
that was before our eyes. When at last we
found our voices our exclamations seemed
ridiculously inadequate to the occasion.</p>

<p>"Heavens! How beautiful it is, how
beautiful!" But we could not find adequate
words for it.</p>

<p>My husband said, "The earth descends
below us." And the words well expressed
the sensation conveyed. The earth seemed
to sink away from us in a wonderful, indeed,
in a terrible, manner. Everything was
wonderful and weird. Indeed, the whole
of such a journey seems a strange and fantastic
dream, luxurious to the senses and
impressively superb. Its beauty cannot be
told, cannot be written. It must be seen and
felt.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking in the west. For a
while the daylight
seemed even more
intense as it was
about to vanish.
Then the sun disappeared;
it had
set. But we rose
and rose, and presently
we saw the
red wonder again.
In simple fact, here
was the sun <em>rising
again</em> for us alone,
and in the west!
But the sight
lasted a very
short time,
and once
more the
great luminary
sank from
sight. We
had seen the
sun set twice
in one evening!</p>

<p>My delight
was inexpressible;
to sit
here beside
my newly-made
husband here in the sky, travelling I
knew not where. Our movement was altogether
imperceptible&mdash;we would seem to be
entirely still; there was no such current of
air even as would cause a quiver in the flame
of a candle. At this time our height was
about 300 or 400 m&egrave;tres, and we gazed over
the edge of the car at the towns, the railway
lines, the fields, and the woods&mdash;all Liliputian
toys, and things to smile at.</p>

<p>We passed over the Buttes-Chaumont, at
Vincennes. I turned my head to ask a question
of Godard, and was terrified to perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that he had in his mouth a large pipe! I
touched my husband's arm, and pointed. He
looked, and with a cry he instantly snatched
the pipe away. "Do you want to blow us
all up?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Godard merely laughed. "Ha! ha!"
he cried, "you don't perceive. There is no
light to it! It is
a mere habit. I
can't do without
my pipe, and I
keep it in my
mouth and imagine
I am smoking.
Come, let me have
it!"</p>

<p>The incident
amused us much,
and for almost the
whole of the remainder
of the
journey the pipe
remained between
Godard's lips, while
he, to all appearance,
smoked
with perfect
satisfaction.</p>

<p>And now we
came by the
mouth of the
Marne. Suddenly
there was
a burst of laughter
among us;
it came from my
husband. At first he could not answer our
questions; then he pointed below, to a place
where we could perceive something moving.
"Listen!" he said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 590px;">
<img src="images/image067.jpg" width="590" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"'DO YOU WANT TO BLOW US ALL UP?' HE EXCLAIMED."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We listened eagerly, and heard cries of
despair in the quiet evening air, far below.
"Flammarion! Flammarion! H&eacute;! Flammarion!
Come down! Come down here!"</p>

<p>There was great excitement in the little
place below. From the garden of a little
house several persons were making signs to
us.</p>

<p>"This is the place," exclaimed Flammarion;
"this is the place, clearly. There is a fatality
in this! My friends, we are exactly and
perpendicularly above the estate of the Abb&eacute;
P&mdash;&mdash;, at La Varenne Saint-Hilaire! Do
you hear? He calls us!"</p>

<p>And indeed it was the fact, the simple fact.
What cruel tricks chance will play!</p>

<p>"Come down! Come down, Flammarion!"
And then the voices of those below died
away, for we had gone from their sight. It
is probable that if we <em>had</em> attempted to
descend just there we should all have experienced
a good bath in the Marne&mdash;a dangerous
river in these parts.</p>

<p>Godard threw out ballast, and we rose
higher still. "What will the Abb&eacute; think?"
I said. "He will never pardon us for this
heart-breaking disappointment!"
And, indeed, to
finish with the poor
Abb&eacute;, I may say
here that he would
never believe the
truth of what had
happened, nor
under what conditions
Ernest Flammarion
had been
allowed to take his
place. He maintained
that we
had arranged the
whole thing beforehand;
and
for more than a
year we saw nothing
of him, notwithstanding
our
friendly attentions
and most cordial
appeals.</p>

<p>Now the moon
shone with such
intensity that the
country stood as
clearly defined as in full daylight, and the time
was half-past nine. Here we were at the
height of 1,900 m&egrave;tres, and we seemed to be
entering into another world. Here all Nature
was in dead silence, superb and terrible; we
were in the clouds. My husband has
described the scene better than I am able.
We were in the starry skies, having at our
feet clouds that seemed vast mountains
of snow&mdash;an impressive, unearthly landscape&mdash;white
alps, glaciers, valleys, ridges,
precipices. An unknown Nature revealed
herself, creating, as in a dream, the most
dazzling and fantastic panoramas. Stupendous
combats between the clouds arose and
rolled; the air-currents followed one another,
hurled and flung themselves in mighty commotion,
shaking and breaking, in dead
silence, the monstrous masses. We felt, we
saw in action, the powerful, incessant, prodigious
forces of the atmosphere, while the
earth slept below.</p>

<p>It was a scene beyond all words. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a monstrous elephant formed itself before
our eyes. We entered into the very midst of
it, and were blinded by the cold and damp
vapour&mdash;a singular and awful cloud, whence
we emerged but to plunge again into others
more awful still; now a furious sea, now a
group of hideous phantoms, now long,
luminous tracts, glittering like streams of
silver in the ghostly white light. "This is
not so pleasant," my brother-in-law murmured.
"Why not descend?"</p>

<p>The billows of
cloud piled together,
terribly
agitated. Above
us, below us and
about us, all was
stirred to fury.
My agitation was
great; for of all
these circumstances
the
silence, the absolute
silence, was
the most terrible.
Amid all the
shocks of the
cloud-masses,
amid all the rages
of the hideous
gigantic phantoms,
of those
fearful forces
that might at any
moment crush
us in a clap of
thunder, not a
sound, even of
the faintest, was
heard. The
balloon glided
through the enervating,
cloud-filled
heavens
steadily and
proudly, and
soon we were
free of the mists, and sailing serenely under
the deep blue sky in the pale light of the
moon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/image068.jpg" width="516" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"A SINGULAR AND AWFUL CLOUD."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"I like this better," said Ernest, and we
agreed with him.</p>

<p>We gazed at the white plain of rolling
clouds below us. What was that&mdash;the little
ball that ran so quickly along the furrowed
white spaces? The little ball edged with an
aureole of tender colours?</p>

<p>"That?" answered Godard. "That is
we ourselves&mdash;the balloon, or rather its
shadow. What do you think of its rate of
travelling, Madame Flammarion&mdash;you who
imagine that we are not moving at all?"</p>

<p>Truly, it was our own shadow, swiftly
skimming the clouds below, a curious and
charming sight.</p>

<p>And now we saw the first signs of dawn.
The balloon sank and sank, and soon we
were skimming above meadows scented with
a thousand perfumes. To us it seemed that
we must touch the trees every moment, so
nearly did we
approach the
earth. But, as a
matter of fact, we
were still a hundred
m&egrave;tres from
the ground.
Again it was a
delightful experience,
thus to
skim above the
earth in the
silent, starry
morning, without
a breath of air
that we could
feel. The plains,
the hills, the rivulets
passed before
us as in a dream.
It was communion
with Nature
indeed.</p>

<p>"Now," said
Godard, suddenly,
"we are
ascending, and
quickly." And,
indeed, as he
spoke we shot
upwards, and in
a moment were
again among the
clouds. In the
distance we observed
a peculiar
light. Was it a lighthouse? No, we were
far from the sea. Reassured on this point,
we are soon uneasy in regard to another, for
presently we saw that lightning-flashes were
traversing the clouds. "It is a storm,"
Godard observed, "and it will be a bad one."</p>

<p>"Then we will throw out ballast and avoid
it," said my husband.</p>

<p>It was done, and instantly we ascended to
the height of 3,000 m&egrave;tres. Now we saw that
the deep blue of the sky was paling, and day
broke. Far above us Sirius glittered, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
a few moments more our
altitude was 4,000 m&egrave;tres,
the highest of the trip.
At this height I breathed
less freely; and everything
liquid in the car&mdash;even
the wine&mdash;was frozen.
We shivered under our
furs, and there was a
humming in my ears. In
spite of these drawbacks
I was as enthusiastic as
ever, and I assured my
husband, who expressed
some solicitude for me,
that I had never been
better, and that I would
be very glad to live in a
balloon! And as for
descending, who could
think of it, with such a
spectacle before us?
Behind us was the moon
and the darkness; below, afar, a storm of
lightning and thunder; and before us, most
wonderful of all, the rising of the sun, filling
the empyrean with his rays and flinging a
mantle of purple and gold over all, clouds
and balloon alike. The mysterious and weird
beauties of the night gave place to the brilliant
metamorphosis of
day.</p>

</div>

<p>And now, alas! we
returned to earth. In
twenty minutes, after
a swift though tranquil
descent from
the height of 4,000
m&egrave;tres, we were again
among our fellow-mortals,
in the neighbourhood
of Spa.
Our trip had lasted
nearly thirteen hours.</p>

<p>The population of
the district had never
seen a balloon so
near, and our arrival
roused the countryside.
The people
came running from
every direction, yelling
and gesticulating,
and scarcely had the
car touched earth
when it was surrounded
so closely by
a crowd of peasants
that it was impossible
for Godard to make proper
arrangements for landing.
By dint of frightful grimaces
and abuse, he induced
them to draw back
sufficiently to enable him
to make fast, and then
my companions were
obliged to protect me:
for the women, and even
some of the men, came to
touch me&mdash;my hair, my
hands, my face, and my
clothes&mdash;to make sure
that I was really alive!</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MADAME FLAMMARION (PRESENT DAY).

</div>

<p>Ernest Flammarion
alighted first. "I am very
happy," he said, "to have
been up in a balloon, but
I don't think I shall go
again."</p>

<p>As for my husband,
his persistent passion for
ballooning is well known; and as for myself,
I have made two more aerial voyages with
him, and I would be glad to make a thousand.</p>

<p>One gets, of course, very little of common
luxuries in a balloon. There is just a car of
basket-work, and a wooden plank for a seat.
The knees must serve for a table, and the head
rests on the edge of
the car when one sits
and rests. The bench
will hold only two at
a time, and even the
two find it a tight fit.
Of course, it is impossible
to cook in a
balloon, for anything
in the nature of fire
would produce an
instant blow-up, and
a scattering of the
whole expedition to
the four winds. The
food one takes consists
of cold meat,
bread, fruit, eggs, and
perhaps salad&mdash;prepared
beforehand. M.
Flammarion carried
his instruments as
usual&mdash;his barometers,
telescopes, thermometers,
and the
rest&mdash;on his wedding
trip, and made scientific
observations and
notes from first to last.</p>

<p>Thanks to the kindness
of Messrs. Bradbury
and Agnew, the
proprietors of <cite>Punch</cite>,
I am able to give to
the general public
some of the pleasure
that comes from the
possession of a complete
set of <cite>Punch</cite>. In
reading one's <cite>Punch</cite>
the pleasure is much
enhanced by Mr. M.
H. Spielmann's most
admirable book, "The
History of Punch"
[<cite>Cassell and Company,
Limited, 1895</cite>], for Mr.
Spielmann is probably
the best living authority
on this subject, and his
researches, which extended
over four years,
enable the ordinary
<cite>Punch</cite>-lover to find
many points of great interest [specially in
the early Volumes] which, without Mr. Spielmann's
book, might be passed over without
notice. Some of the <cite>Punch</cite> engravings now
shown have been found by the aid of Mr.
Spielmann's book, which is a thoroughly
reliable and quite indispensable Text-Book
on <cite>Punch</cite>, while, on other points, I have
been privileged to consult Mr. W. Lawrence
Bradbury and Mr. Philip L. Agnew as well
as Mr. Spielmann himself.</p>

<p>When the Queen came to the throne there
was no <cite>Punch</cite>. He was conceived in circumstances
of much mystery, for many have
claimed the honour of his paternity. The historian
of <cite>Punch</cite> has devoted a long chapter
to this matter of <cite>Punch's</cite> paternity, and has
judicially weighed the evidence for or against
each claimant. Mr. Spielmann writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yet although it was not ... Henry Mayhew
who was the actual initiator of <cite>Punch</cite>, it was unques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tionably
he to whom the whole credit belongs of
having developed Landell's specific idea of a
"Charivari," and of its conception in the form it
took. Though not the absolute author of its existence,
he was certainly the author of its literary and
artistic being, and to that degree, as he was wont to
claim, he was its <em>founder</em>.</p></div>

<p>Thus, the opinion of the best authority is
that Henry Mayhew and Ebenezer Landells
were the real founders of <cite>Punch</cite>.</p>

<p>Early in 1841, after several discussions
between the members of the first staff of
<cite>Punch</cite>, the original prospectus was drawn up
by Mark Lemon. The first page of this
three-page foolscap document is shown in
reduced facsimile in illustration No. 1 of this
article. An excellent facsimile, on the
original blue foolscap paper, is bound up in
a little anonymous pamphlet published in
the year 1870,
"Mr. Punch: His
Origin and
Career": but Mr.
Bradbury told me
that many of the
statements about
<cite>Punch</cite> in this
pamphlet are erroneous,
although
the document is
an exact copy of
the original in
Mr. Bradbury's
possession, which
happens just now
to be packed away
in a warehouse,
and so cannot be
photographed.</p>

<div class="bbox"><p class="ph3">THE LEGEND OF JAWBRAHIM-HERAUDEE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There once lived a king in Armenia, whose name was Poof-Allee-Shaw; he
was called by his people, and the rest of the world who happened to hear
of him, Zubberdust, or, the Poet, founding his greatest glory, like
Bulwer-Khan, Moncktoon-Milnes-Sahib, Rogers-Sam-Bahawder, and other
lords of the English Court, not so much on his possessions, his ancient
race, or his personal beauty (all which, 'tis known, these Frank emirs
possess), as upon his talent for poetry, which was in truth amazing.</p>

<p>He was not, like other sovereigns, proud of his prowess in arms, fond of
invading hostile countries, or, at any rate, of reviewing his troops
when no hostile country was at hand, but loved Letters all his life
long. It was said, that, at fourteen, he had copied the Shah-Nameh
ninety-nine times, and, at the early age of twelve, could repeat the
Koran backwards. Thus he gained the most prodigious power of memory; and
it is related of him, that a Frank merchant once coming to his Court,
with a poem by Bulwer-Khan called the Siamee-Geminee (or, Twins of
Siam), His Majesty, Poof-Allee, without understanding a word of the
language in which that incomparable epic was written, nevertheless
learned it off, and by the mere force of memory, could repeat every
single word of it.</p>

<p>Now, all great men have their weakness; and King Poof-Allee, I am sorry
to say, had his. He wished to pass for a poet, and not having a spark of
originality in his composition, nor able to string two verses together,
would, with the utmost gravity, repeat you a sonnet of Hafiz or Saadee,
which the simpering courtiers applauded as if it were his own.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting
to see in No. 1
that the name
<cite>Punch</cite> was substituted
for the
struck-out title,
"The Fun&mdash;&mdash;."
It has been suggested
that the
title thus cut short
in favour of the
single word <cite>Punch</cite>
was to have been
"The Funny Dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
with Comic Tales," and the prospectus ends
with the words, "Funny dogs with comic
tales." The price was written "Twopence,"
although the price of <cite>Punch</cite> has always been
Threepence.</p>

</div>

<p>As regards the sudden change of title to
<cite>Punch</cite>&mdash;a change made, as we see from the
facsimile, while Mark Lemon was in the
very act of writing the title&mdash;Mr. Spielmann
has recorded that there are as many versions
as to the origin of <cite>Punch's</cite> name as of the
origin of the periodical itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hodder declares that it was Mayhew's sudden
inspiration. Last asserted that when "somebody" at
the <em>Edinburgh Castle</em> meeting spoke of the paper,
like a good mixture of punch, being nothing without
Lemon, Mayhew caught at the idea and cried, "A
capital idea! We'll call it <cite>Punch</cite>!"</p></div>

<p>There have been many other claimants to
the distinction of having thought of the title
"Punch," which is certainly an infinitely
better title than "Funny Dogs with Comic
Tales" and much better than "The Funny
Dogs," which I suggest may have been the
title Mark Lemon began to write, judging
from the place on the paper (see No. 1),
where he began with the
words, "The Fun&mdash;&mdash;";
for if he had intended to
write the longer title, "The
Funny Dogs with Comic
Tales," he must have run
the last part of this long
title too far to the right of
his paper to be consistent
with the symmetrical position
given to his other
headings, etc., on the sheet
of foolscap: a practised
writer unconsciously allows
enough space for the symmetrical
setting out of his
headlines, etc., and that
Mark Lemon was a specially
practised writer is
very clearly shown by
inspection of this interesting
facsimile.</p>

<div class="bbox"><p class="ph3">THE PRINCE OF WALES.&mdash;HIS FUTURE TIMES.</p>

<p>A private letter from Hanover states that, precisely at twelve
minutes to eleven in the morning on the ninth of the present November,
his majesty King <span class="smcap">Ernest</span> was suddenly attacked by a violent
fit of blue devils. All the court doctors were immediately summoned,
and as immediately dismissed, by His Majesty, who sent
for the Wizard of the North (recently appointed royal astrologer), to
divine the mysterious cause of this so sudden melancholy. In a trice
the mystery was solved&mdash;Queen Victoria "was happily delivered of a
Prince!" His Majesty was immediately assisted to his chamber&mdash;put
to bed&mdash;the curtains drawn&mdash;all the royal household ordered to
wear list slippers&mdash;the one knocker to the palace was carefully tied up&mdash;and
(on the departure of our courier) half a load of straw was
already deposited beneath the window of the royal chamber. The
sentinels on duty were prohibited from even sneezing, under pain of
death, and all things in and about the palace, to use a brand new simile,
were silent as the grave!</p>

<p>"Whilst there was only the Princess Royal there were many hopes.
There was hope from severe teething&mdash;hope from measles&mdash;hope from
hooping-cough&mdash;but with the addition of a Prince of Wales, the
hopes of Hanover are below par." But we pause. We will no
further invade the sanctity of the sorrows of a king; merely observing,
that what makes his Majesty very savage, makes hundreds of thousands
of Englishmen mighty glad. There are now two cradles
between the Crown of England and the White Horse of Hanover.</p>

<p>We have a Prince of Wales! Whilst, however, England is throwing
up its million caps in rapture at the advent, let it not be forgotten
to whom we owe the royal baby. In the clamorousness of our joy
the fact would have escaped us, had we not received a letter from
Colonel <span class="smcap">Sibthorp</span>, who assures us that we owe a Prince of Wales
entirely to the present cabinet; had the Whigs remained in office,
the infant would inevitably have been a girl.</p>

<p>The first number of

Wellington Street, Strand.
There was a good demand
for it, two editions of five
thousand copies each being
sold in two days. This
demand was caused by advertising
in various ways, including
the distribution of
100,000 copies of a printed

<div class="caption"><p>8.&mdash;A SUPPOSITITIOUS OFFER TO "PUNCH." 1842.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the first Volume of <cite>Punch</cite> I have
chosen the five pictures here numbered 2, 3,
4, 6, and 7. No. 2 is the first picture in
<cite>Punch</cite>, a distinction that
gives importance to this
little sketch [the same size
as the original] of a broken-down
man at work on the
tread-mill. By the first
picture, I mean the first
that was printed on the
numbered pages of <cite>Punch</cite>&mdash;this
is on page 2 of
Vol. I.&mdash;for the <cite>Introduction</cite>
contained three wood-cuts,
and there was the
outside wrapper&mdash;of which
I shall speak later. But
this little cut in No. 2 is
really the first of Mr.
Punch's famous gallery of
black-and-white art. It
was drawn by William
Newman, and this is one
of his so-called "blackies"&mdash;little
<em>silhouettes</em> that were
paid for at the rate of
eighteen shillings per
dozen.</p>

<p>No. 3 is the first of
Mr. Punch's long series
of cartoons. This was
done by A. S. Henning,
and it makes a much nicer
picture in its present reduced
size than in its
original large size, where
the work is too coarse in
texture. In the forties,
there were no ingenious
photographic processes for
reproducing an
artist's work to any
scale; the work had
to be cut on the
wood-block and
shown the same
size as the original
drawing. Hence,
in a weekly paper
such as <cite>Punch</cite>,
there was often
not much time to
spend on the wood-engraving,
and so
many of the drawings,
especially the
early ones, are
wanting in finish.</p>

<p>This comical
sketch in No. 8
was, I suspect,
suggested to Mr.
Punch by one of
the many offers
of unsolicited
"outside" contributions
which
have always been
severely discouraged.
Mr. Punch
prefers to rely
upon his own
staff, although he
is always on the
alert for fresh
talent, and
amongst the
clever men who
have thus been
invited to contribute
to <cite>Punch</cite> are
Mr. H. W. Lucy
("Toby, M.P."),
Mr. R. C. Lehmann
(who wrote
"The Adventures
of Picklock
Holes"), Mr. Bernard Partridge (the brilliant
successor to Mr. du Maurier), and Mr. Phil
May.</p>

<p>We see in No. 9
the first <cite>Punch</cite> picture
of the Prince of
Wales. This cartoon
was drawn by Kenny
Meadows. The
Queen is standing at
the left of the infant
Prince, and points to
the first tooth, the
doctor blows a toy-trumpet
and offers
some soldiers, while
the lady who kneels
is offering a baby's
coral with a <cite>Punch's</cite>
head as its chief
attraction.</p>

<p>No. 10 is a very

full account of this
supposititious
discovery is given
on page 142-3

<cite>Punch</cite>, in the
year 1843, and
this curiosity was

<p>The cartoon in
No. 11 is the first
by another of
Mr. Punch's
great guns&mdash;the
famous Richard
Doyle. This appeared
on March
16, 1844; and
"The Modern
Sisyphus" is Sir
Robert Peel,
then Premier,
seen in the task
of rolling up the
great stone
[Daniel O'Connell,
the Irish
orator, who was
then agitating for the repeal of the union
between Ireland and Great Britain], while Lord
John Russell and
others represent
"The Furies" who
are watching Peel's
unavailing exertions.
The sign-manual at
the right of this cartoon&mdash;a
dicky-bird
perched on a D&mdash;was
often used by
Richard Doyle, and
may be seen on the
present wrapper of

No. 11 is the first

by Doyle, it is not
the first work he did

<p>John Leech's
cartoon, in No.
12, was published
September
14, 1844; the
Prince de Joinville
was in command
of the
French Navy,
and there was
some foolish talk
in the French
papers about an
invasion of England.
The expression
of the
Duke of Wellington's
face in this
cartoon is simply
perfect, as he stands with his hands in his
pockets calmly looking at the threatening
Joinville, and
quietly says to
the Frenchman,
"You're too
good a judge to
hit me, you are!"
One is irresistibly
reminded by this
clever cartoon of
a quite recent
affair with our
French neighbour,
in which
the relative positions
were not
unlike those here

<p>We are not among those who like going on with the March of
Intellect at the old jog-trot pace, for we rather prefer running on before
to loitering by the side, and we have consequently taken a few strides in
advance with Geography, by furnishing a Map of England, as it will be
in another year or two. Our country will, of course, never be in chains,
for there would be such a general bubbling up of heart's blood, and such
a bounding of British bosoms, as would effectually prevent that; but
though England will never be in chains, she will pretty soon be in irons,
as a glance at the numerous new Railway prospectuses will testify. It is
boasted that the spread of Railways will shorten the time and labour of
travelling; but we shall soon be unable to go anywhere without
crossing the line.&mdash;which once used to be considered a very formidable
undertaking. We can only say that we ought to be going on very smoothly,
considering that our country is being regularly ironed from one end of it
to the other.</p>

<div class="bbox"><p class="ph3">THE LAST NEW RAILWAY SCHEME.</p>

<p>Our modern projectors having exhausted
the old world of railways above ground,
have invented a new world of a subterranean
kind, in which they propose to
construct lines "under the present wide,
leading streets of London" This is a
magnificent notion for relieving the
over-crowded thoroughfares, and at the
same time relieving any particularly
over-crowded pocket from its oppressive
burden. The prospectus states that the
thing "can be accomplished without any
serious engineering difficulties." The
difficulties, instead of being serious, will,
we suppose, be merely laughable. If any
great dilemma should arise, it will of
course be overcome by a little jocularity.</p>

<p>We understand that a survey has already been made, and that many
of the inhabitants along the line have expressed their readiness to place
their coal-cellars at the disposal of the company. It is believed that
much expense may be saved by taking advantage of areas, kitchens,
and coal-holes already made, through which the trains may run without
much inconvenience to the owners, by making a judicious arrangement
of the time-table. It will certainly be awkward if a family should
be waiting for a scuttle of coals, and should not be able to get it until
after the train had gone by; but a little domestic foresight, seconded
by railway punctuality, will obviate all annoyances of this kind.</p>

<p>As the contemplated railway must in several places by carried
through the sides and centre of a street, it will be necessary to arrange
with the gas and water companies, so that they may all co-operate in
this great national work. If the atmospheric principle should be
adopted, arrangements could perhaps be entered into to obtain the use
of the principal main belonging to the water-works as a continuous
valve; for if we are to judge by the arrangements on the Croydon
line, this continuous valve is a tremendous pipe, which merely lies in
the middle of the line without being used.</p>

<p>The Sewers, by the way, would, with a little enlargement answer
all the purposes of the projectors of this scheme. It is true they are
half full of water; but this would not prevent the carriages from being
propelled, and the wheels might be sufficiently high to keep the bodies
of the carriages and the feet of the passengers out of the wet.</p>

<p>Considering the frequent stoppages of the existing thoroughfares,
the scheme really seems to deserve encouragement. "Nothing is
wanted" says the prospectus, "for this grand undertaking, but public
support." If the people will only come down with their money,
we should not wonder at seeing the company get as far as half-a-dozen
advertisements in the daily papers, and a brass plate in the City.
Those who are disposed to sink a little capital cannot do better than
bury it under the Metropolis in the manner proposed.</p>

<p>We perceive that no amount of deposit is named, and nothing is
said of the number or nominal value of the shares. The Secretary is
announced to be in attendance to receive deposits from eleven to two:
though, whether he gets any is, in our opinion, ten to one.</p>

<p>No. 16 introduces us to a
very early <cite>Punch</cite>-picture of
Benjamin Disraeli [June,
1845]; not the first, which
was, Mr. Philip Agnew tells
me, in the year 1844, but this
is the more interesting picture
of the two. Mr. Punch was
sometimes very severe in his
treatment of Disraeli, and this
sketch with the accompanying
verses is a good example of
<cite>Punch's</cite> early satire. As regards
Mr. Punch's politics, it
is interesting to quote the
following words from "The
History of <cite>Punch</cite>":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Table" [<em>i.e.</em>, the weekly
<cite>Punch</cite> dinner-table at which the cartoons,
etc., are discussed.&mdash;J. H. S.]
has always shown an amalgam of
Conservative and Liberal instincts
and leanings, although the former
have never been those of the "predominant
partner." The constant
effort of the Staff is to be fair and
patriotic, and to subordinate their
personal views to the general good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
For, whatever the public may think, neither Editor nor
Staff is bound by any consideration to any party or
any person, but hold themselves free to satirise or to
approve "all round."</p></div>

<p>When No. 16 was published, Disraeli was
the leader of the "Young England" party,
having some years previously been converted
from a Radical into a Tory: hence the
allusions contained in the lines below this
sketch.</p>

<p>The vivid "Portrait of the Railway Panic,"
by Doyle, No. 17, was
published November 8,
1845, and refers to the
depression in railway-dividends
then being
caused by over-competition
in railway-promotion;
No. 20 also refers
to the railway-schemes
of that time, and is Mr.
Punch's ironical notice
[dated September 26,
1846] of "The Last New
Railway Scheme," <em>i.e.</em>, the
proposal for making an
Underground Railway,
which, as we here read,
was scoffed at by <cite>Punch</cite>&mdash;"The
Secretary is
announced to be in
attendance to receive deposits
from eleven to two;
though, whether he gets
any is, in our opinion,
ten to one." But immediately
below these words
Mr. Punch gives a sectional
diagram of the
Underground Railway as
he conceived it, and it is
not a bad shot at "A
prophetic view of the
subterranean railways."
As a matter of fact, the
works for the now familiar
Metropolitan (Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ground)
Railway were commenced in 1860;

<p>No. 18 is one of John Leech's jokes on
fishermen's tales, and No. 19 is another joke
probably based on fact. The amusing
picture, No. 21, illustrating "The Rising
Generation," is also by John Leech.</p>

<p>No. 22 is a curiosity. It was drawn by
Thackeray and published on page 59 of
Volume XII., February 6, 1847. From that
day to this more than fifty years, no one has
discovered the
point of this joke by
Thackeray. "The
History of <cite>Punch</cite>"
records that on the
appearance of this
sketch the "Man
in the Moon"
offered "a reward
of &pound;500 and a free
pardon" to anyone
who would publish
an explanation.
The reward was
never claimed.</p>

<p>What <em>does</em> this
sketch mean? Is
the shorter female
a servant caught in
the act of trying on
her mistress's best cap?
But if so, why is the
"scene" placed in a room
that seems to be a library
and not a bedroom? And
is the object on, or near,
the front of the taller
woman's dress, the falling
cap of the servant? But if
so, how does the servant's
cap come to be falling as
the figures are placed&mdash;there
is no sign on the part
of the servant [?] that she
has just dropped the cap [?]
from her left hand? This
is truly a puzzle and will
probably never be solved,
although when one remembers
that this was drawn by
Thackeray, and passed, as
one may suppose, by Mark
Lemon, the Editor of <cite>Punch</cite>
in the year 1847, both men of
keen wit, it is scarcely possible
to think that this joke
does not contain any point.</p>

<p>A sketch of "Domestic Bliss" is shown in
No. 23, and No. 24 is a picture by Richard
Doyle of "Mr. John Bull after an attack of
Income-Tax." This was published in the
spring of 1848, and must I think have been
the outcome of a then-recent smart from an
ordinary income-tax payment by Mr. Punch,
for on turning up the income-tax records I
find that the rate was not unusually high in
the year 1848, the tax being 7d. in the &pound; for
the years 1846 to 1852.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> mineral waters of Spinbronn,
in Hundsruck, a few leagues
from Pirmesans, formerly enjoyed
an excellent reputation,
for Spinbronn was the rendezvous
of all the gouty and
rheumatic members of the German aristocracy.
The wild nature of the surrounding
country did not deter the visitors, for they
were lodged in charming villas at the foot of
the mountain. They bathed in the cascade
which fell in large sheets of foam from the
summit of the rocks, and drank two or three
pints of the water every day. Dr. Daniel
Haselnoss, who prescribed for the sick and
those who thought they were, received his
patients in a large wig, brown coat, and
ruffles, and was rapidly making his fortune.</p>

<p>To-day, however, Spinbronn is no longer
a favourite watering-place. The fashionable
visitors have disappeared; Dr. Haselnoss has
given up his practice; and the town is only
inhabited by a few poor, miserable woodcutters.
All this is the result of a succession
of strange and unprecedented catastrophes,
which Councillor Bremen, of Pirmesans,
recounted to me the other evening.</p>

<p>"You know, Mr. Fritz," he said, "that
the source of the Spinbronn flows from a
sort of cavern about 5ft. high, and from 10ft.
to 15ft. across; the water, which has a temperature
of 67deg. centigrade, is salt. The
front of the cavern is half hidden by moss,
ivy, and low shrubs, and it is impossible to
find out the depth of it, because of the
thermal exhalations which prevent any
entrance.</p>

<p>"In spite of that, it had been remarked for
a century that the birds of the locality,
hawks, thrushes, and turtle-doves, were
engulphed in full flight, and no one knew of
what mysterious influence it was the result.
During the season of 1801, for some unexplained
reason, the source became more
abundant, and the visitors one evening,
taking their constitutional promenade on the
lawns at the foot of the rocks, saw a human
skeleton descend from the cascade.</p>

<p>"You can imagine the general alarm, Mr.
Fritz. It was naturally supposed that a
murder had been committed at Spinbronn
some years before, and that the victim had
been thrown into the source. But the
skeleton, which was blanched as white as
snow, only weighed twelve pounds; and Dr.
Haselnoss concluded that, in all probability,
it had been in the sand more than three
centuries to have arrived at that state of
desiccation.</p>

<p>"Plausible as his reasoning was, it did not
prevent many visitors leaving that same day,
horrified to have drunk the waters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
really gouty and rheumatic ones, however,
stayed on, and consoled themselves with the
doctor's version. But the following days the
cavern disgorged all that it contained of
detritus; and a veritable ossuary descended
the mountain&mdash;skeletons of animals of all
sorts, quadrupeds, birds, reptiles. In fact,
all the most horrible things that could be
imagined.</p>

<p>"Then Haselnoss wrote and published a
pamphlet to prove that all these bones were
relics of the antediluvian world, that they
were fossil skeletons, accumulated there in a
sort of funnel during the universal Deluge,
that is to say, four thousand years before
Christ; and, consequently, could only be
regarded as stones, and not as anything
repulsive.</p>

<p>"But his work had barely reassured the
gouty ones, when one fine morning the
corpse of a fox, and then of a hawk, with all
its plumage, fell from the cascade. Impossible
to maintain that these had existed
before the Deluge, and the exodus became
general.</p>

<p>"'How horrible!' cried the ladies. 'That
is where the so-called virtue of mineral
waters springs from. Better die of rheumatism
than continue such a remedy.'</p>

<p>"At the end of a week the only visitor left
was a stout Englishman, Commodore Sir
Thomas Hawerbrook, who lived on a grand
scale, as most
Englishmen do.
He was tall and
very stout, and of
a florid complexion.
His
hands were literally
knotted with
gout, and he
would have drunk
no matter what
if he thought it
would cure him.
He laughed loudly
at the desertion of
the sufferers, installed
himself in
the best of the
villas, and announced
his intention
of spending
the winter at
Spinbronn."</p>

<p>Here Councillor
Bremen leisurely
took a large pinch
of snuff to refresh
his memory, and with the tips of his fingers
shook off the tiny particles which fell on his
delicate lace jabot. Then he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Five or six years before the revolution of
1789, a young doctor of Pirmesans, called
Christian Weber, went to St. Domingo to
seek his fortune. He had been very successful,
and was about to retire, when the revolt
of the negroes occurred. Happily he escaped
the massacre, and was able to save part of
his fortune. He travelled for a time in South
America, and about the period of which I
speak, returned to Pirmesans, and bought
the house and what remained of the practice
of Dr. Haselnoss.</p>

<p>"Dr. Christian Weber brought with him
an old negress called Agatha; a very ugly
old woman, with a flat nose, and enormous
lips. She always enveloped her head in a
sort of turban of the most startling colours;
and wore rings in her ears which reached to
her shoulders. Altogether she was such a
singular-looking creature, that the mountaineers
came from miles around just to
look at her.</p>

<p>"The doctor himself was a tall, thin
man, invariably dressed in a blue swallow-tailed
coat and leather breeches. He
talked very little, his laugh was dry and
nervous, and his habits most eccentric.
During his wanderings he had collected a
number of insects of almost every species,
and seemed to be
much more interested
in them
than in his patients.
In his
daily rambles
among the mountains
he often
found butterflies
to add to his
collection, and
these he brought
home pinned to
the lining of his
hat.</p>

<p>"Dr. Weber,
Mr. Fritz, was
my cousin and
my guardian, and
directly he returned
to Germany
he took
me from school,
and settled me
with him at Spinbronn.
Agatha
was a great friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of mine, though at first she frightened me,
but she was a good creature, knew how to
make the most delicious sweets, and could
sing the most charming songs.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas and Dr. Weber were on
friendly terms, and spent long hours together
talking of subjects beyond my comprehension&mdash;of
transmission of fluids, and mysterious
things which they had observed in their
travels. Another mystery to me was the
singular influence which the doctor appeared
to have over the negress, for though she was
generally particularly lively, ready to be
amused at the slightest thing, yet she
trembled like a leaf if she encountered her
master's eyes fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"I have told you that birds, and even
large animals, were engulphed in the
cavern. After the disappearance of the
visitors, some of the old inhabitants
remembered that about fifty years before
a young girl, Loisa Muller, who lived with
her grandmother in a cottage near the
source, had suddenly disappeared. She had
gone out one morning to gather herbs, and
was never seen or heard of again, but her
apron had been found a few days later near
the mouth of the cavern. From that it was
evident to all that the skeleton about which
Dr. Haselnoss had written so eloquently
was that of the poor girl, who had, no doubt,
been drawn into the cavern by the mysterious
influence which almost daily acted upon
more feeble creatures. What that influence
was nobody could tell. The superstitious
mountaineers believed that the devil inhabited
the cavern, and terror spread throughout the
district.</p>

<p>"One afternoon, in the month of July, my
cousin was occupied in classifying his insects
and re-arranging them in their cases. He
had found some curious ones the night
before, at which he was highly delighted. I
was helping by making a needle red-hot in
the flame of a candle.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas, lying back in a chair near
the window and smoking a big cigar, was
regarding us with a dreamy air. The commodore
was very fond of me. He often
took me driving with him, and used to like
to hear me chatter in English. When the
doctor had labelled all his butterflies, he
opened the box of larger insects.</p>

<p>"'I caught a magnificent horn-beetle
yesterday,' he said, 'the <i lang="la">lucanus cervus</i> of the
Hartz oaks. It is a rare kind.'</p>

<p>"As he spoke I gave him the hot needle,
which he passed through the insect preparatory
to fixing it on the cork. Sir
Thomas, who had taken no notice till then,
rose and came to the table on which the
case of specimens stood. He looked at the
spider of Guyana, and an expression of
horror passed over his rubicund features.</p>

<p>"'There,' he said, 'is the most hideous
work of the Creator. I tremble only to look
at it.'</p>

<p>"And, sure enough, a sudden pallor spread
over his face.</p>

<p>"'Bah!' said my guardian, 'all that is
childish nonsense. You heard your nurse
scream at a spider, you were frightened,
and the impression has remained. But if
you regard the creature with a strong microscope,
you would be astonished at the
delicacy of its organs, at their admirable
arrangement, and even at their beauty.'</p>

<p>"'It disgusts me,' said the commodore,
brusquely. 'Pouff!'</p>

<p>"And he walked away.</p>

<p>"'I don't know why,' he continued, 'but
a spider always freezes my blood."</p>

<p>"Dr. Weber burst out laughing, but I felt
the same as Sir Thomas, and sympathized
with him.</p>

<p>"'Yes, cousin, take away that horrid
creature,' I cried. 'It is frightful, and spoils
all the others.'</p>

<p>"'Little stupid,' said he, while his eyes
flashed, 'nobody compels you to look at
them. If you are not pleased you can go.'</p>

<p>"Evidently he was angry, and Sir Thomas,
who was standing by the window regarding
the mountains, turned suddenly round, and
took me by the hand.</p>

<p>"'Your guardian loves his spiders, Frantz,'
he said, kindly. 'We prefer the trees and
the grass. Come with me for a drive.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, go,' returned the doctor, 'and be
back to dinner at six.' Then, raising his
voice, 'No offence, Sir Thomas,' he said.</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas turned and laughed, and we
went out to the carriage.</p>

<p>"The commodore decided to drive himself,
and sent back his servant. He placed
me on the seat beside him, and we started
for Rothalps. While the carriage slowly
mounted the sandy hill, I was quiet and sad.
Sir Thomas, too, was grave, but my silence
seemed to strike him.</p>

<p>"'You don't like the spiders, Frantz;
neither do I. But, thank Heaven! there
are no dangerous ones in this country. The
spider which your cousin has in his box is
found in the swampy forests of Guyana,
which is always full of hot vapours and
burning exhalations, for it needs a high
temperature to support its existence. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
immense web, or rather its net, would surround
an ordinary thicket, and birds are
caught in it, the same as flies in our spiders'
webs. But do not think any more about it;
let us drink a glass of Burgundy.'</p>

<p>"As he spoke he lifted the cover of the
seat, and, taking out a flask of wine, poured
me out a full leathern goblet.</p>

<p>"I felt better when I had drunk it, and we
continued our way. The carriage was drawn
by a little Ardennes pony, which climbed the
steep incline as lightly and actively as a goat.
The air was full of the murmur of myriads
of insects. At our right was the forest of
Rothalps. At our left was the cascade of
Spinbronn; and the higher we mounted, the
bluer became the silver sheets of water
foaming in the distance, and the more
musical the sound as the water passed over
the rocks.</p>

<p>"Both Sir Thomas and I were captivated
by the spectacle, and, lost in a reverie, allowed
the pony to go on as he would. Soon we
were within a hundred paces of the cavern of
Spinbronn. The shrubs around the entrance
were remarkably green. The water, as it
flowed from the cavern, passed over
the top of the rock, which was slightly
hollowed, and there formed a small
lake, from which it again burst forth
and descended into the valley below.
This lake was shallow, the bottom of
it composed of sand and black pebbles,
and, although covered with a
slight vapour, the water was clear and
limpid as crystal.</p>

<p>"The pony stopped to breathe.
Sir Thomas got out and walked about
for a few seconds.</p>

<p>"'How calm it is,' he said.</p>

<p>"Then, after a minute's silence, he
continued: 'Frantz, if you were not
here, I should have a bathe in that
lake.'</p>

<p>"'Well, why not?' I answered. 'I
will take a walk the while. There
are numbers of strawberries to be
found a little way up that mountain.
I can go and get some, and be back
in an hour.'</p>

<p>"'Capital idea, Frantz. Dr. Weber
pretends that I drink too much Burgundy;
we must counteract that with
mineral water. This little lake looks
inviting.'</p>

<p>"Then he fastened the pony to
the trunk of a tree, and waved his
hand in adieu. Sitting down on the
moss, he commenced to take off his
boots, and, as I walked away, he called
after me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In an hour, Frantz.'</p>

<p>"They were his last words.</p>

<p>"An hour after I returned. The pony,
the carriage, and Sir Thomas's clothes were
all that I could see. The sun was going
down and the shadows were lengthening.
Not a sound of bird or of insect, and a silence
as of death filled the solitude. This silence
frightened me. I climbed on to the rock
above the cavern, and looked right and left.
There was nobody to be seen. I called; no
one responded. The sound of my voice
repeated by the echoes filled me with terror.
Night was coming on. All of a sudden I remembered
the disappearance of Loisa Muller,
and I hurried down to the front of the cavern.
There I stopped in affright, and glancing
towards the entrance, I saw two red, motionless
points.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/image085.jpg" width="507" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"I SAW TWO RED, MOTIONLESS POINTS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"A second later I distinguished some
dark moving object farther back in the
cavern, farther perhaps than human eye had
ever before penetrated; for fear had sharpened
my sight, and given all my senses an acute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ness
of perception which I had never before
experienced.</p>

<p>"During the next minute I distinctly heard
the chirp, chirp of a grasshopper, and the
bark of a dog in the distant village. Then
my heart, which had been frozen with terror,
commenced to beat furiously, and I heard
nothing more. With a wild cry I fled,
leaving pony and carriage.</p>

<p>"In less than twenty minutes, bounding
over rocks and shrubs, I reached my cousin's
door.</p>

<p>"'Run, run,' I cried, in a choking tone, as
I burst into the room where Dr. Weber and
some invited friends were waiting for us.
'Run, run; Sir Thomas is dead; Sir Thomas
is in the cavern,' and I fell fainting on the
floor.</p>

<p>"All the village turned out to search for
the commodore. At ten o'clock they returned,
bringing back Sir Thomas's clothes,
the pony, and carriage. They had found
nothing, seen nothing, and it was impossible
to go ten paces into the cavern.</p>

<p>"During their absence Agatha and I
remained in the chimney-corner, I still
trembling with fear, she, with wide open
eyes, going from time to time to the window,
from which we could see the torches passing
to and fro on the mountain, and hear the
searchers shout to one another in the still
night air.</p>

<p>"At her master's approach Agatha began
to tremble. The doctor entered brusquely,
pale, with set lips. He was followed by
about twenty woodcutters, shaking out the
last remnants of their nearly extinguished
torches.</p>

<p>"He had barely entered before, with flashing
eyes, he glanced round the room, as if in
search of something. His eyes fell on the
negress, and without a word being exchanged
between them the poor woman began to cry.</p>

<p>"'No, no, I will not,' she shrieked.</p>

<p>"'But I will,' returned the doctor, in a
hard tone.</p>

<p>"The negress shook from head to foot, as
though seized by some invisible power. The
doctor pointed to a seat, and she sat down
as rigid as a corpse.</p>

<p>"The woodcutters, good, simple people,
full of pious sentiments, crossed themselves,
and I, who had never yet heard of the
hypnotic force, began to tremble, thinking
Agatha was dead.</p>

<p>"Dr. Weber approached the negress, and
passed his hands over her forehead.</p>

<p>"'Are you ready?' he said.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Sir Thomas Hawerbrook.'</p>

<p>"At these words she shivered again.</p>

<p>"'Do you see him?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, yes,' she answered, in a gasping
voice, 'I see him.'</p>

<p>"'Where is he?'</p>

<p>"'Up there, in the depths of the cavern&mdash;dead!'</p>

<p>"'Dead!' said the doctor; 'how?'</p>

<p>"'The spider! oh, the spider!'</p>

<p>"'Calm yourself,' said the doctor, who
was very pale. 'Tell us clearly.'</p>

<p>"'The spider holds him by the throat&mdash;in
the depths of the cavern&mdash;under the rock&mdash;enveloped
in its web&mdash;Ah!'</p>

<p>"Dr. Weber glanced round on the people,
who, bending forward, with eyes starting out
of their heads, listened in horror.</p>

<p>"Then he continued: 'You see him?'</p>

<p>"'I see him.'</p>

<p>"'And the spider. Is it a big one?'</p>

<p>"'O Master, never, never, have I seen
such a big one. Neither on the banks of
the Mocaris, nor in the swamps of Konanama.
It is as large as my body.'</p>

<p>"There was a long silence. Everybody
waited with livid face and hair on end.
Only the doctor kept calm. Passing his
hand two or three times over the woman's
forehead, he recommenced his questions.
Agatha described how Sir Thomas's death
happened.</p>

<p>"'He was bathing in the lake of the
source. The spider saw his bare back from
behind. It had been fasting for a long time,
and was hungry. Then it saw Sir Thomas's
arm on the water. All of a sudden it rushed
out, put its claws round the commodore's
neck. He cried out, "Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu."
The spider stung him and went back, and
Sir Thomas fell into the water and died.
Then the spider returned, spun its web
round him, and swam slowly, gently back to
the extremity of the cavern; drawing Sir
Thomas after it by the thread attached to its
own body.'</p>

<p>"I was still sitting in the chimney corner,
overwhelmed with fright. The doctor turned
to me.</p>

<p>"'Is it true, Frantz, that the commodore
was going to bathe?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, cousin.'</p>

<p>"'At what time?'</p>

<p>"'At four o'clock.'</p>

<p>"'At four o'clock? It was very hot then,
was it not?'</p>

<p>"'Yes; oh, yes.'</p>

<p>"'That's it. The monster was not afraid
to come out then.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"He spoke a few unintelligible words, and
turned to the peasants.</p>

<p>"'My friends,' he cried, 'that is where
the mass of <em>d&eacute;bris</em> and those skeletons come
from. It is the spider which has frightened
away your visitors, and ruined you all. It is
there hidden in its web, entrapping its prey
into the depths of the cavern. Who can say
the number of its victims?'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 483px;">
<img src="images/image087.jpg" width="483" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"IT RUSHED OUT AND PUT ITS CLAWS AROUND THE COMMODORE'S NECK."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"He rushed impetuously from the house,
and all the woodcutters hurried after him.</p>

<p>"'Bring fagots, bring fagots!' he cried.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes later two immense carts,
laden with fagots, slowly mounted the hill;
a long file of woodcutters followed, with
hatchets on their shoulders. My guardian
and I walked in front, holding the horses by
the bridle; while the moon lent a vague,
melancholy light to the funereal procession.</p>

<p>"At the entrance of the cavern the <em>cort&eacute;ge</em>
stopped. The torches were lighted and the
crowd advanced. The limpid water flowed
over the sand, reflecting the blue light of
the resinous torches, the rays of which
illuminated the tops of the dark, overhanging
pines on the rocks above us.</p>

<p>"'It is here you must unload,' said the
doctor. 'We must block up the entrance
of the cavern.'</p>

<p>"It was not without a feeling of dread
that they commenced to execute his order.
The fagots fell from the tops of the carts,
and the men piled them up before the
opening, placing some stakes against them to
prevent their being carried away by the
water. Towards midnight the opening was
literally closed by the fagots. The hissing
water below them flowed right and left over
the moss, but those on the top were perfectly
dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Dr. Weber took a lighted torch,
and himself set fire to the pile. The flames
spread from twig to twig, and rose towards
the sky, preceded by dense clouds of smoke.
It was a wild, strange sight, and the woods
lighted by the crackling flames had a weird
effect. Thick volumes of smoke proceeded
from the cavern, while the men standing
round, gloomy and motionless, waited with
their eyes fixed on the opening. As for me,
though I trembled from head to foot, I could
not withdraw my gaze.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/image088.jpg" width="650" height="470" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"ONE OF THE MEN THREW HIS HATCHET."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"We waited quite a quarter of an hour,
and Dr. Weber began to be impatient, when
a black object, with long, crooked claws,
suddenly appeared in the shadow, and then
threw itself forward towards the opening.
One of the men, fearing that it would leap
over the fire, threw his hatchet, and aimed at
the creature so well that, for an instant, the
blood which flowed from its wound half-quenched
the fire, but soon the flame revived,
and the horrible insect was consumed.</p>

<p>"Evidently driven by the heat, the spider
had taken refuge in its den. Then, suffocated
by the smoke, it had returned to the charge,
and rushed into the middle of the flames.
The body of the horrible creature was as
large as a man's, reddish violet in colour, and
most repulsive in appearance.</p>

<p>"That, Mr. Fritz, is the strange event
which destroyed the reputation of Spinbronn.
I can swear to the exactitude of my story,
but it would be impossible for me to give
you an explanation. Nevertheless, admitting
that the high temperature of certain thermal
springs furnishes the same conditions of
existence as the burning climate of Africa
and South America, it is not unreasonable to
suppose that insects, subject to its influence,
can attain an enormous development.</p>

<p>"Whatever may have been the cause, my
guardian decided that it would be useless
to attempt to resuscitate the waters of Spinbronn;
so he sold his house, and returned to
America with his negress and his collection."</p>

Grays, the station next to
historical Purfleet, on the
London and Tilbury line to
Southend? If not, let me tell
you that it is not a large place,
nor a nice place either. Still, this struggling

Almost within the shadow of its tiny red

in England for the making of sailors,
and soldiers, and citizens&mdash;for the making of
men.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>THE "EXMOUTH."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Proceeding a short distance along the
main street towards the river the traveller
will be brought face to face with this civilizing
centre. He will see a huge, bold, sturdy vessel
riding proudly upon the ebbing and flowing
tide, moored about a hundred yards off the
shore. This splendid three-decker, of 3,106
tons displacement and with a measurement
of 220ft. by 59ft., is London's training ship
<em>Exmouth</em>.</p>

<p>The vessel's ninety-one portholes still
proclaim its original character&mdash;that of a man-of-war;
even though her armament consists
now of but two truck and two field pieces,
instead of the ninety-one guns which should
be mounted there. Its complement of 600
lads, its Captain-Superintendent, and staff of
officers still more eloquently testify to its
intimate connection with the defences of the
country&mdash;with the Navy and the Army,
with the development of patriotism and
citizenship. For, from this training ship
have gone forth about 5,700 youths, well
equipped for the struggle of existence,
and not less well trained to battle with
winds and waves and the treachery of oceans
deep. Indeed, of these 5,700 no fewer than
2,106 went to swell the ranks of the Royal
Navy; 446 shipped as ordinary seamen;
1,385 as deck and cabin boys; 150 as
apprentices, and 300 as assistant cooks and
stewards. And again, within the same
period, 900 have joined the Army as band
boys; whilst hundreds, once more, embarked
with average fair success upon other occupations,
taking to handicrafts, trades, and
industries for which they received their first
moral and sound practical training on board
this veteran three-decker.</p>

<p>A large part of the striking prosperity
which has attended the <em>Exmouth</em> is undoubtedly
due to the most competent
Captain-Superintendent in Staff-Commander
W. S. Bourchier. Entering the
Navy in 1840, as a navigating midshipman
on board the <em>Impregnable</em>, this officer had,
previous to his appointment to the <em>Goliath</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in 1870, passed through a school of excellent
training. After successive services as navigating
sub-lieutenant, first in the Mediterranean,
on board the <em>Polyphemus</em>; then on
the south-east coast of America, on the brigantine
<em>Griffon</em>, he
had (upon being
promoted navigating
lieutenant)
held the command
of the <em>Myrtle</em>,
steamer-tender to
the flagship, for
close on twelve
years. And this
varied and instructive
career Captain
Bourchier had
been able to complete
by a further
service as navigating
lieutenant to
the then Captain,
now Admiral, Sir
Anthony Hoskins,
on board the

With so thoroughly trained and

<p>So successful, indeed, has been
the training and other educational
work carried on on board this
splendid three-decker that the last
report of Admiral Bosanquet, than
whom as Inspecting Captain-General
of Naval Training Ships there can
hardly be a better authority, may
be taken as typical. In this report
he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The training ship <em>Exmouth</em> for boys is
in most excellent order. The drills and
instructions are exceedingly well taught,
and the comfort and well-being of the
lads is sedulously attended to. Captain
Bourchier's arrangements are admirable
and conscientiously carried out by a very
able staff of officers. It is a <em>model training
ship</em>.</p></div>

</div>

<p>And a model training ship the
<em>Exmouth</em> truly is; the brief history
of which, who knows? may be a not
unimportant factor in the making
of British history. To appreciate
this paradox, reader, you must see
this tiny, yet withal so manly, crew
as it was a short time ago my good
fortune to see them when I visited the vessel,
piloted by that genial assistant clerk to the
Metropolitan Asylums Board, Mr. John
Mallett. The notice informing the Captain-Superintendent
of our intended visit, I afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
learned, had reached him but a few
minutes previous to our arrival. Yet the
moment we appeared on the landing-stage,
the wind carried to us five notes of an
assembly call. This was the only distinct sign
of life on board. But scarcely had it passed by
when, as if by magic, the cutters and whalers,
the gigs and pinnaces, and the launches of
the <em>Exmouth</em> were manned and afloat;
when on the main and upper decks, and on
the bowsprit, and up the fore, main, and
mizzen masts swarmed Lilliputians to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
posts, every tiny man ready to "do his
duty." Though, to be sure, it is not
an easy duty these sailor boys have to
perform, for the routine and discipline on
board the <em>Exmouth</em> is as that on board a
man-of-war, tempered only by a consideration
of the youth of the crew and by the maxim
that "kindness
leads farther than
harshness."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>FIELD-GUN DRILL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the early
morning, when the
bugle calls for the
speedy slinging up
of their hammocks
on the orlop deck,
till late in the
evening, when the
general retreat is
sounded and the
hammock's are
once more unslung,
the various
boat-crews and
classes are kept
going. Yet not
as fancy's whim
suggests; maxims
evolved from
sound experience
inspire the educational
system on board. For instance, cleanliness
is said to be next to godliness. The two,
again, are known to be most conducive to
discipline. At the same time, the strictest
observance of these three precepts is recognised
to be absolutely essential to the well-being
of a large floating establishment. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
conformity with these truisms, thorough
ablutions and thoughtful religious practices,
such as morning and evening prayers, at which
both officers and crew attend, are, therefore,
as prominent features of the training on the
<em>Exmouth</em> as is the
excellent discipline
maintained
on board the
vessel. The ablutions,
however,
are particularly
worthy of mention;
the process
is so original.
There is a huge,
broad tank-bath
in the lavatory;
not much smaller
than a usual-sized
swimming bath.
Thither the lads
proceed in marching
order, though,
of course, without
any baggage, however
slight; and
promptly start to
give themselves a
wholesome shampoo with carbolic soap.
Being thus lathered they plunge head foremost
into the tank. Diving straight through
its full width, with wonderful agility they
then bound over its anything but low side,
landing&mdash;at attention&mdash;before the
officer on watch, ready for inspection as
to their outward
cleanliness.</p>

</div>

<p>This agility, this
precision in the
action and decision
in the conduct
of the boy-sailors
and marines, is
noticeable at
whatever occupation
they may be.
Such perfection is
to a great extent
due to the lads'
instruction in
gymnastics and
athletics. As the
several illustrations
show, in
these they pass
through a most
comprehensive
and systematic
course. They are trained in whatever may
tend towards the development of their
muscles. So efficiently are the boys taught,
that those whom I have seen at my visit go
through most difficult exercises on the horizontal
and parallel bars and on the spring-board,
I would safely have compete with
the best model sections or Masterriegen
of Germany's leading gymnastic societies.
Yet the Fatherland is the home and,
as it were, the academy of systematic
physical culture! Highly satisfactory, too, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
not truly astonishing, is the perfect manner
in which the Lilliputians on board the
<em>Exmouth</em> take to their musketry, bayonet, and
cutlass drill. Reader, you need but look at
the illustrating snap-shots to feel that, when
grown up or even before, these lads will
prove men and warriors bold and true should
occasion arise. Indeed, as it is, when
witnessing the earnestness and skill with
which each command
of the drill-masters
is executed,
you soon
fancy to be face to
face with a company
of marines&mdash;veterans
in the
exercise of arms&mdash;although,
in
fact, they are a
company of mere
boys, rescued from
the streets and
recruited from the
workhouses. And
as veterans in arms
they behave at
gun drill. At
mounting or dismounting
field-pieces,
at charging
or discharging
the truck-guns, they are equally smart.
How well the crews are trained, both
in the use of rifle, cutlass, and cannon,
and in their more extensive and complicated
application to military tactics, is demonstrated
by the photos, illustrating a sham-fight
between a party of sailors and an
imaginary enemy. It can be seen at a glance
that the proceedings are looked upon by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
boys as something more than an amusing
intermezzo in their daily routine; with them
it is a serious lesson to be learned seriously.</p>

<p>However, the champions of disarmament
and the advocates of peace must not assume
that the training ship's youthful crew is
reared up only in the spirit of militarism,
and instructed only in the manifold defensive
and offensive uses of the weapons of
war. The picture showing the boy sailors
and marines engaged upon Samaritan work,
carried out with a promptitude and circumspection
of which a master in surgery need
not be ashamed, would already disprove
their assumption. Yet, they may feel further
assured that these principles
of assisting the suffering
are not confined in
their educational operation
to the mere bandaging and
nursing of the wounded.
These are inculcated into
the mind and heart of
the lads by many other
methods, and applicable to
many and far different situations.</p>

<p>For, hand in hand with
their military training, the
wards of the Metropolitan
Asylums Board receive the
benefit of moral training
and a sound elementary
education under the able
direction of Mr. W. Hollamby,
the head
schoolmaster on
board the vessel.
This education, in
spite of a rather
small staff, considering
the hundreds
of pupils,
is not only equal
to that provided
at any Metropolitan
Board School,
but it aspires, justifiably,
because
successfully&mdash;even
beyond&mdash;at a
higher, more comprehensive,
more
thorough-going
instruction, excellent
though teaching
in London's
Board Schools frequently
is.</p>

<p>Nor is the industrial side forgotten in the
system of training on the <em>Exmouth</em>. Tailoring,
carpentering, painting, sail and net-making,
and so on, are part of the trades the
boys have to learn and to prove efficient at.
Indeed, most of the extensive and often
difficult repairs constantly necessary to the
three-decker, to her many boats, and to the
boys' own outfits, are done by the latter,
and done by these youngsters remarkably
well, as, reader, you will see for yourself,
if your good fortunes ever ship you to the
<em>Exmouth</em>. I say advisedly "good fortunes,"
because there is a healthiness, a breeziness
about the ship, about its captain, officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
and numerous crew which truly smacks of
the free, wholesome, bracing sea, and which
cannot fail to act upon the visitor from the
town as an excellent nerve-tonic.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MUSICAL DRILL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This healthiness, this breeziness, as it
were, this sea-atmosphere is, however, easily
accounted for by the very nature, by the very
purpose of the vessel. Is not the aim of
the education, of the training, on board the
<em>Exmouth</em> above all to produce sailors of the
type of those who have made England what
she is to-day&mdash;the Queen and the beneficent
Ruler Of the
Oceans and the
foremost colonizing
and civilizing
Power on earth?
Naturally, to
achieve this aim
the tasks which
devolve alike upon
instructors and instructed
are manifold
and heavy.
How many thousand
and one details
have to be taught&mdash;and
learned?
How many thousand
and one
minute elements
are necessary to
the making of
genuine seamen of these boys? As
kindly paymaster, Mr. A. Thompson, puts
it in his "<em>Exmouth</em> Song":&mdash;</p>

<p>But it quickly comes all right; the
instructors and the lads' hearts are in their
work. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They very soon pass a torn-i-key (tourniquet)<br /></span>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes, to be sure; a more practical
lesson, which brings the matter truly home,
is wanted. As for instance when:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They go for a pull, and whilst afloat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch a crab that knocks them down in the boat.<br /></span>

</div>
<p>Yet here, too, all things work towards a
good end. Therefore:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To them that crab a lesson will be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make them smart sailors in the Queen's Navee.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>And that these Liliputian men on board
the <em>Exmouth</em> become smart sailors is vouchsafed
not only by Captain-Superintendent
Bourchier, and his capable chief officer,
Mr. Wellman; not only by the brigantine
<em>Steadfast</em>, the three-decker's sailing tender,
and, as our illustration shows, a bold, handsome
yacht, of 100 tons burden, with
roomy decks and comfortable quarters for
fifty lads; but it is also vouchsafed by her
weather-beaten commander, Mr. Thomas
Hall, than whom there is scarcely a more
confidence-inspiring, able salt. Indeed, our
Navy owes much to this brigantine. Apart
from the nautical training she affords to the
<em>Exmouth</em> boys, it is she who, by means of her
constant cruises to southern and western
ports, brings her complement of excellently
taught youths to the direct notice of the
captains of our men-of-war. How much they
appreciate the budding sailors thus brought
before them is shown by the fact that on
each return from such a cruise the crew of
the brigantine is considerably reduced. But
not in consequence of desertions. No, the
men-of-war men like the lads, and the lads
like the men-of-war men. So it comes to pass
that the sailor-boys of London's Training
Ship <em>Exmouth</em> become blue-jackets of the
Nation and her Queen. And once embarked
upon this career we may safely leave them,
although, reader, I would fain tell you yet of
the large and exceptionally skilled band on
board the three-decker which supplies our
Navy and, particularly, our Army with so
many able musicians every year. I would
fain tell you of the Infirmary and its
devoted matron, and of the Shipping Home
at Limehouse, kept in connection with
the training ship for the purpose of providing
to the <em>Exmouth</em> lads berths on board
merchantmen, and of affording them some
safe anchorage when momentarily without a
vessel through no fault of their own. I would
fain enlist your co-operation in agitating for
the increase of training ships such as the one
I have endeavoured to describe to you, inasmuch
as in these, I hold, lies the strength of
our future Navy and supremacy of the seas.
But space does not permit me. May I
be at least consoled by the hope that I
have roused your interest in, and kindled
your sympathy for, the <em>Exmouth</em> and her
officers and crew.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course, there is a deal of
bullying done at sea at times,
said the night watchman,
thoughtfully. The men call
it bullying an' the officers call
it discipline, but it's the same
thing under another name. Still, it's fair in
a way. It gets passed on from one to
another. Everybody aboard a'most has got
somebody to bully, except, perhaps, the
smallest boy; he 'as the worst of it, unless
he can manage to get the ship's cat by itself
occasionally.</p>

<p>I don't think sailor-men mind being
bullied. I never 'eard of it's putting one off
'is feed yet, and that's the main thing, arter
all's said and done.</p>

<p>Fust officers are often worse than skippers.
In the fust place, they know they ain't
skippers, an' that alone is enough to put 'em
in a bad temper, especially if they've 'ad
their certifikit a good many years and can't
get a vacancy.</p>

<p>I remember, a good many years ago now,
I was lying at Calcutta one time in the
<em>Peewit</em>, as fine a barque as you'd wish to see,
an' we 'ad a fust mate there as was a disgrace
to 'is sects. A nasty, bullying, violent man,
who used to call the hands names as
they didn't know the meanings of and what
was no use looking in the dictionary for.</p>

<p>There was one chap aboard, Bill Cousins,
as he used to make a partikler mark of.
Bill 'ad the misfortin to 'ave red 'air, and the
way the mate used to throw that in 'is face
was disgraceful. Fortunately for us all, the
skipper was a very decent sort of man, so
that the mate was only at 'is worst when he
wasn't by.</p>

<p>We was sitting in the fo'c's'le at ten one
arternoon, when Bill Cousins came down,
an' we see at once 'e'd 'ad a turn with the
mate. He sat all by hisself for some time
simmering, an' then he broke out. "One
o' these days I'll swing for 'im; mark my
words."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Bill," ses Joe Smith.</p>

<p>"If I could on'y mark 'im," says Bill,
catching his breath. "Just mark 'im fair an'
square. If I could on'y 'ave 'im alone for
ten minutes, with nobody standing by to
see fair play. But, o' course, if I 'it 'im it's
mutiny."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do it if it wasn't, Bill," ses
Joe Smith again.</p>

<p>"He walks about the town as though the
place belongs to 'im," said Ted Hill. "Most
of us is satisfied to shove the niggers out o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the way, but he ups fist an' 'its 'em if they
comes within a yard of 'im."</p>

<p>"Why don't they 'it 'im back?" ses Bill.
"I would if I was them."</p>

<p>Joe Smith grunted. "Well, why don't
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"'Cos I ain't a nigger," ses Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, but you might be," ses Joe, very
soft. "Black your face an' 'ands an' legs,
and dress up in them cotton things, and go
ashore and get in 'is way."</p>

<p>"If you will, I will, Bill," ses a chap called
Bob Pullin.</p>

<p>Well, they talked it over and over, and at
last Joe, who seemed to take a great interest
in it, went ashore and got the duds for 'em.
They was a tight fit for Bill, Hindu's not
being as wide as they might be, but Joe said
if 'e didn't bend about he'd be all right, and
Pullin, who was a smaller man, said his was
fust class.</p>

<p>After they were dressed, the next question
was wot to use to colour them with; coal was
too scratchy, an' ink Bill didn't like. Then
Ted Hill burnt a cork and started on Bill's
nose with it afore it was cool, an' Bill didn't
like that.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere," ses the carpenter, "nothin'
seems to please you, Bill&mdash;it's my opinion
you're backing out of it."</p>

<p>"You're a liar," ses Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got some stuff in a can as
might be boiled-down Hindu for all you
could tell to the difference," ses the
carpenter; "and if you'll keep that ugly
mouth of your's shut, I'll paint you myself."</p>

<p>Well, Bill was a bit flattered, the carpenter
being a very superior sort of a man,
and quite an artist in 'is way, an' Bill sat
down an' let 'im do 'im with some stuff out
of a can that made 'im look like a Hindu
what 'ad been polished. Then Bob Pullin
was done too, an' when they'd got their
turbins on, the change in their appearance
was wonderful.</p>

<p>"Feels a bit stiff," ses Bill, working 'is
mouth.</p>

<p>"That'll wear off," ses the carpenter; "it
wouldn't be you if you didn't 'ave a grumble,
Bill."</p>

<p>"And mind and don't spare 'im. Bill,"
ses Joe. "There's two of you, an' if you
only do wot's expected of you, the mate
ought to 'ave a easy time abed this v'y'ge."</p>

<p>"Let the mate start fust," ses Ted Hill.
"He's sure to start on you if you only get in
'is way. Lord, I'd like to see his face when
you start on 'im!"</p>

<p>Well, the two of 'em went ashore after
dark with the best wishes o' all on board,
an' the rest of us sat down in the fo'c's'le
spekerlating as to what sort o' time the mate
was goin' to 'ave. He went ashore all right,
because Ted Hill see 'im go, an' he noticed
with partikler pleasure as 'ow he was dressed
very careful.</p>

<p>It must ha' been near eleven o'clock. I
was sitting with Smith on the port side o' the
galley, when we heard a 'ubbub approaching
the ship. It was the mate just coming
aboard. He was without 'is 'at; 'is neck-tie
was twisted round 'is ear, and 'is shirt and
'is collar was all torn to shreds. The second
and third officers ran up to him to see what
was the matter, and while he was telling
them, up comes the skipper.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me, Mr. Fingall,"
ses the skipper, in surprise, "that you've been
knocked about like that by them mild and
meek Hindus?"</p>

<p>"Hindus, sir?" roared the mate. "Cert'n'y
not, sir. I've been assaulted like this by
five German sailor-men. And I licked 'em
all."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that," ses the skipper;
and the second and third pats the mate on
the back, just like you pat a dog you don't
know.</p>

<p>"Big fellows they was," ses he, "an' they
give me some trouble. Look at my eye!"</p>

<p>The second officer struck a match and
looked at it, and it cert'n'y was a beauty.</p>

<p>"I hope you reported this at the police-station?"
ses the skipper.</p>

<p>"No, sir," ses the mate, holding up 'is 'ed.
"I don't want no p'lice to protect me. Five's
a large number, but I drove 'em off, and I
don't think they'll meddle with any British
fust officers again."</p>

<p>"You'd better turn in," ses the second,
leading him off by the arm.</p>

<p>The mate limped off with him, and as soon
as the coast was clear we put our 'eds together
and tried to make out how it was that Bill
Cousins and Bob 'ad changed themselves
into five German sailor-men.</p>

<p>"It's the mate's pride," ses the carpenter.
"He didn't like being knocked about by
Hindus."</p>

<p>We thought it was that, but we had to wait
nearly another hour afore the two came
aboard, to make sure. There was a difference
in the way they came aboard, too, from
that of the mate. <em>They</em> didn't make no
noise, and the fust thing we knew of their
coming aboard was seeing a bare, black foot
waving feebly at the top of the fo'c's'le ladder
feelin' for the step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>That was Bob. He came down without a
word, and then we see 'e was holding another
black foot and guiding it to where it should
go. That was Bill, an' of all the 'orrid, limp-looking
blacks that you ever see, Bill was the
worst when he got below. He just sat on a
locker all of a heap and held 'is 'ed, which
was swollen up, in 'is hands. Bob went and
sat beside 'im, and there they sat, for all
the world like two wax-figgers instead o'
human beings.</p>

<p>"Well, you done it, Bill?" ses Joe, after
waiting a long time for them to speak. "Tell
us all about it!"</p>

<p>"Nothin' to tell," ses Bill, very surly.
"We knocked 'im about."</p>

<p>"And he knocked us about," ses Bob,
with a groan. "I'm sore all over, and as
for my feet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wot's the matter with them?" ses Joe.</p>

<p>"Trod on," ses Bob, very short. "If my
bare feet was trod on once they was a dozen
times. I've never 'ad such a doing in all my
life. He fought like a devil. I thought he'd
ha' murdered Bill."</p>

<p>"I wish 'e 'ad," ses Bill, with a groan;
"my face is bruised and cut about cruel. I
can't bear to touch it."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"IT CERT'N'Y WAS A BEAUTY."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Do you mean to say the two of you
couldn't settle 'im?" ses Joe, staring.</p>

<p>"I mean to say we got a hiding," ses Bill.
"We got close to him fust start off and got
our feet trod on. Arter that it was like fighting
a windmill, with sledge-hammers for sails."</p>

<p>He gave a groan and turned over in his
bunk, and when we asked him some more
about it, swore at us. They both seemed
quite done up, and at last dropped off to
sleep just as they was, without even stopping
to wash the black off or to undress themselves.</p>

<p>I was awoke rather early in the morning
by the sounds of somebody talking to themselves,
and a little splashing of water. It
seemed to go on a long while, and at last I
leaned out of my bunk and see Bill bending
over a bucket and washing himself and using
bad language.</p>

<p>"Wot's the matter, Bill?" ses Joe, yawning
and sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>"My skin's that tender, I can hardly touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
it," ses Bill, bending down and rinsing 'is face.
"Is it all orf?"</p>

<p>"Orf?" ses Joe; "no, o' course it ain't.
Why don't you use some soap?"</p>

<p>"Soap," answers Bill, mad-like; "why, I've
used more soap than I've used for six months
in the ordinary way."</p>

<p>"That's no good," ses Joe; "give yourself
a good wash."</p>

<p>Bill put down the soap then very careful,
and went over to 'im and told him all the
dreadful things he'd do to him when he got
strong ag'in, and then Bob Pullin got out of
his bunk an' 'ad a try on <em>his</em> face. Him
an' Bill kept washing, and then taking each
other to the light and trying to believe it
was coming off until they got sick of it, and
then Bill 'e up with his foot and capsized
the bucket, and walked up and down the
fo'c's'le raving.</p>

<p>"Well, the carpenter put it on," ses a
voice, "make 'im take it orf."</p>

<p>You wouldn't believe the job we 'ad to
wake that man up. He wasn't fairly woke
till he was hauled out of 'is bunk an' set
down opposite them two pore black fellers
an' told to make 'em white again.</p>

<p>"I don't believe as there's anything will
touch it," he ses, at last. "I forgot all about
that."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," bawls Bill, "that
we've got to be black all the rest of our life?"</p>

<p>"Certrily not," ses the carpenter, indignantly,
"it'll wear off in time; shaving every
morning'll 'elp it, I should say."</p>

<p>"I'll get my razor now," ses Bill, in a
awful voice; "don't let 'im go, Bob. I'll
'ack 'is head orf."</p>

<p>He actually went off an' got his razor, but
o' course, we jumped out o' our bunks and
got between 'em and told him plainly that it
was not to be, and then we set 'em down and
tried everything we could think of, from
butter and linseed oil to cold tea-leaves used
as a poultice, and all it did was to make 'em
shinier an' shinier.</p>

<p>"It's no good, I tell you," ses the carpenter,
"it's the most lasting black I know. If I
told you how much that stuff is a can, you
wouldn't believe me."</p>

<p>"Well, you're in it," ses Bill, his voice all
of a tremble; "you done it so as we could
knock the mate about. Whatever's done to
us'll be done to you too."</p>

<p>"I don't think turps 'll touch it," ses
the carpenter, getting up, "but we'll 'ave
a try."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image101.jpg" width="700" height="455" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"HE BURIED HIS FACE IN IT."</p></div>
</div>

<p>He went and fetched the can and poured
some out on a bit o' rag and told Bill to dab
his face with it. Bill give a dab, and the
next moment he rushed over with a scream
and buried his head in a shirt what Simmons
was wearing at the time and began to wipe
his face with it. Then he left the flustered
Simmons an' shoved another chap away
from the bucket and buried his face in it and
kicked and carried on like a madman. Then
'e jumped into his bunk again and buried 'is
face in the clothes and rocked hisself and
moaned as if he was dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you use it, Bob," he ses, at last.</p>

<p>"'Tain't likely," ses Bob. "It's a good
thing you tried it fust, Bill."</p>

<p>"'Ave they tried holy-stone?" ses a voice
from a bunk.</p>

<p>"No, they ain't," ses Bob, snappishly,
"and, what's more, they ain't goin' to."</p>

<p>Both o' their tempers was so bad that we
let the subject drop while we was at breakfast.
The orkard persition of affairs could no
longer be disregarded. Fust one chap threw
out a 'int and then another, gradually getting
a little stronger and stronger, until Bill turned
round in a uncomfortable way and requested
of us to leave off talking with our mouths
full and speak up like Englishmen wot we
meant.</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way, Bill," ses Joe, soft-like.
"As soon as the mate sees you there'll
be trouble for all of us."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 539px;">
<img src="images/image102.jpg" width="539" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE TWO MEN WAS SCROUGED UP IN A CORNER."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"For all of us," repeats Bill, nodding.</p>

<p>"Whereas," ses Joe, looking round for
support, "if we gets up a little collection for
you and you should find it convenient to
desart."</p>

<p>"'Ear 'ear," ses a lot o' voices. "Bravo,
Joe."</p>

<p>"Oh, desart is it?" ses Bill; "an' where
are we goin' to desart to?"</p>

<p>"Well, that we leave to you," ses Joe;
"there's many a ship short-'anded as would
be glad to pick up sich a couple of prime
sailor-men as you an' Bob."</p>

<p>"Ah, an' wot about our black faces?" ses
Bill, still in the same sneering, ungrateful
sort o' voice.</p>

<p>"That can be got over," ses Joe.</p>

<p>"'Ow?" ses Bill and Bob together.</p>

<p>"Ship as nigger-cooks," ses Joe, slapping
his knee and looking round triumphant.</p>

<p>It's no good trying to do some people a
kindness. Joe was perfectly sincere, and
nobody could say but wot it wasn't a good
idea, but o' course Mr. Bill Cousins must
consider hisself insulted, and I can only
suppose that the trouble he'd gone through
'ad affected his brain. Likewise Bob Pullins.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's the only excuse I can make
for 'em. To cut a long story short, nobody
'ad any more breakfast, and no time to do
anything until them two men was scrouged
up in a corner an' 'eld there unable to
move.</p>

<p>"I'd never 'ave done 'em," ses the car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>penter,
arter it was all over, "if I'd known
they was goin' to carry on like this. They
wanted to be done."</p>

<p>"The mate'll half murder 'em," ses Ted
Hill.</p>

<p>"He'll 'ave 'em sent to gaol, that's wot
he'll do," ses Smith. "It's a serious matter
to go ashore and commit assault and battery
on the mate."</p>

<p>"You're all in it," ses the voice o' Bill
from the floor. "I'm going to make a clean
breast of it. Joe Smith put us up to it, the
carpenter blacked us, and the others encouraged
us."</p>

<p>"Joe got the clothes for us," ses Bob. "I
know the place he got 'em from, too."</p>

<p>The ingratitude o' these two men was sich
that at first we decided to have no more to
do with them, but better feelings prevailed,
and we held a sort o' meeting to consider
what was best to be done. An' everything
that was suggested one o' them two voices
from the floor found fault with and wouldn't
'ave, and at last we 'ad to go up on deck,
with nothing decided upon, except to swear
'ard and fast as we knew nothing about it.</p>

<p>"The only advice we can give you," ses
Joe, looking back at 'em, "is to stay down
'ere as long as you can."</p>

<p>A'most the fust person we see on deck
was the mate, an' a pretty sight he was. He'd
got a bandage round 'is left eye, and a black
ring round the other. His nose was swelled
and his lip cut, but the other officers were
making sich a fuss over 'im, that I think he
rather gloried in it than otherwise.</p>

<p>"Where's them other two 'ands?" he ses
by-and-by, glaring out of 'is black eye.</p>

<p>"Down below, sir, I b'lieve," ses the
carpenter, all of a tremble.</p>

<p>"Go an' send 'em up," ses the mate to
Smith.</p>

<p>"Yessir," ses Joe, without moving.</p>

<p>"Well, go on then," roars the mate.</p>

<p>"They ain't over and above well, sir, this
morning," ses Joe.</p>

<p>"Send 'em up, confound you," ses the
mate, limping towards 'im.</p>

<p>Well, Joe give 'is shoulder a 'elpless sort o'
shrug and walked forward and bawled down
the fo'c's'le.</p>

<p>"They're coming, sir," he ses, walking
back to the mate just as the skipper came
out of 'is cabin.</p>

<p>We all went on with our work as 'ard as
we knew 'ow. The skipper was talking to
the mate about 'is injuries, and saying unkind
things about Germans, when he give a sort
of a shout and staggered back staring. We
just looked round, and there was them two
blackamoors coming slowly towards us.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"'GOOD HEAVENS, MR. FINGALL,' SES THE OLD MAN. 'WHAT'S THIS?'"</p></div>
</div>

<p>I never see sich a look on any man's
face as I saw on the mate's then. Three
times 'e opened 'is mouth to speak, and
shut it ag'in without saying anything. The
veins on 'is forehead swelled up tremen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>dous
and 'is cheeks was all blown out
purple.</p>

<p>"That's Bill Cousins' hair," ses the skipper
to himself. "It's Bill Cousins' hair. It's
Bill Cus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bob walked up to him, with Bill lagging a
little way behind, and then he stops just in
front of 'im and fetches up a sort o' little
smile.</p>

<p>"Don't you make those faces at me, sir,"
roars the skipper. "What do you mean by
it? What have you been doing to yourselves?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', sir," ses Bill, 'umbly; "it was
done to us."</p>

<p>The carpenter, who was just going to
cooper up a cask which 'ad started a bit,
shook like a leaf, and give Bill a look that
would ha' melted a stone.</p>

<p>"Who did it?" ses the skipper.</p>

<p>"We've been the wictims of a cruel outrage,
sir," ses Bill, doing all 'e could to avoid the
mate's eye, which wouldn't be avoided.</p>

<p>"So I should think," ses the skipper.
"You've been knocked about, too."</p>

<p>"Yessir," ses Bill, very respectful; "me
and Bob was ashore last night, sir, just for a
quiet look round, when we was set on to by
five furriners."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" ses the skipper; and I won't
repeat what the mate said.</p>

<p>"We fought 'em as long as we could, sir,"
ses Bill, "then we was both knocked senseless,
and when we came to ourselves we was
messed up like this 'ere."</p>

<p>"What sort o' men were they?" asked the
skipper, getting excited.</p>

<p>"Sailor-men, sir," ses Bob, putting in his
spoke. "Dutchies or Germans, or something
o' that sort."</p>

<p>"Was there one tall man, with a fair
beard," ses the skipper, getting more and
more excited.</p>

<p>"Yessir," ses Bill, in a surprised sort o'
voice.</p>

<p>"Same gang," ses the skipper. "Same
gang as knocked Mr. Fingall about, you may
depend upon it. Mr. Fingall, it's a mercy
for you you didn't get your face blacked
too."</p>

<p>I thought the mate would ha' burst. I can't
understand how any man could swell as he
swelled without bursting.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," he ses, at
last.</p>

<p>"Why not?" ses the skipper, sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," ses the mate, his voice
trembling with passion. "I 'ave my reasons."</p>

<p>"I s'pose you don't think these two poor
fellows went and blacked themselves for fun,
do you?" ses the skipper.</p>

<p>The mate couldn't answer.</p>

<p>"And then went and knocked themselves
about for more fun?" says the skipper, very
sarcastic.</p>

<p>The mate didn't answer. He looked
round helpless like, and see the third officer
swopping glances with the second, and all
the men looking sly and amused, and I think
if ever a man saw 'e was done 'e did at that
moment.</p>

<p>He turned away and went below, and the
skipper arter reading us all a little lecture on
getting into fights without reason, sent the
two chaps below ag'in and told 'em to turn in
and rest. He was so good to 'em all the
way 'ome, and took sich a interest in seeing
'em change from black to brown and from
light brown to spotted lemon, that the mate
daren't do nothing to them, but gave us their
share of what he owed them as well as an
extra dose of our own.</p>

The Disappearing
Chickens.</h3></div>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> incident took place in the
spring of 1897, at French's Farm,
Netherfield, near Battle, Sussex.
This farm lies in the midst of the
chicken-raising district, and it was
at the time in the occupation of Mr. W. A.
Williams. Mr. Williams, among his other
farm operations, reared thousands of chickens,
which the travelling higglers would collect
and fatten for the market. Most of these
chickens were hatched in an incubator and
reared by aid of a foster-mother&mdash;which
latter, by the way, is not a motherly old hen,
as some might suppose, but a sort of box
lined with flannel. Sometimes it is merely
an old coop.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MOTHERLESS AND INQUISITIVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The farm was surrounded by woods, and
at first many chicks were lost by raids of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
foxes. To check the foxes, Mr. Williams
washed the coops well with carbolic acid, and
let his dogs loose at night. This was effectual.
Mr. Williams's tailless sheepdog "Satan"
and a spaniel bitch had many a moonlight fox
hunt together. Satan, by the way, was a
peculiar dog, very quiet, but a game fighter
when roused.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time the chickens prospered, and
then, one morning, Mr. Williams found but
three left out of some twenty-five fresh-hatched
the day before. It was very odd.
Mr. Williams couldn't understand it, and his
dog Satan seemed equally puzzled. The
chicks had been turned out in excellent
health the day before, twenty-five inquisitive, little, fuzzy activities, all agog to examine the
world. Now there were but three, and not a
scrap or a fragment of fluff left to suggest
what had happened.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"THE DOG? NONSENSE; LOOK AT HIM!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>The thing occurred again and again, and
the mystery was dense as ever. It couldn't
be foxes, because they almost always kill a
few for the sake of killing, and leave them
lying about. Was it rats? No, there were
no rats, said the rat-catcher who was called
in. But still the disappearances went
on, and morning after morning fifteen or
twenty of yesterday's chicks were not to be
found; and the door of their coop was
opened, or knocked down. If it were a
human thief, why did he leave any at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
all? And besides, a man entering the yard
at night would have been pounced on by the
dogs at once. At last, in desperation, a
friend suggested that perhaps the sheepdog
knew something of it. But that was altogether
unlikely&mdash;one had only to glance at
him to see it. He was always a kindly
guardian&mdash;almost a parent to the motherless
chicks. He was chained up just
outside the farm-house door all day, with
a brood of happy chicks ever in his
kennel and his food-pan, and, indeed,
hopping all over him fearlessly, and nothing
they could do ruffled his placid temper or
changed his benevolent aspect. So the
mystery continued, and was deep as ever.</p>

<img src="images/image108-1.jpg" width="345" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>LISTENING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Till one morning it happened to be necessary
for Mr. Williams to rise just after dawn,
and as he did so he looked out of his bedroom
window. There stood Satan, the sheepdog,
listening intently at the house door. As
he listened and his master watched, there
presently came along a batch of young chicks.
Plainly the door of their coop had been
opened again, and they had been let out.
And then Mr. Williams gasped. For straightway
the dog turned and calmly began snapping
up the chicks, bolting them whole, as Mr.
Williams expresses it, "like oysters." He
had thus disposed of eight or nine in rapid
succession, when Mr. Williams made a noise
at the window, and the dog instantly fled.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GULP! THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>That day Mr. Williams took particular care
to move the chickens near him as he lay by
his kennel, and to watch. But, no&mdash;the
cunning rascal would take no notice of them
at all. They ran and tumbled all about
him, but he let them run. He was a hypocrite,
consummate and proved, and he left
the farm that evening.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-a.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A </span>thousand years ago there
lived a King and a Queen.
They had only one daughter,
who was dearer to them than
all the world. Now, when the
King of France sent to their
Court to request the hand of the Princess,
neither father nor mother would part from
their beloved daughter, and they said to the
Ambassador: "She is still too young!"</p>

<p>But as the girl became every day more
beautiful, the next year the King of Spain's
Ambassador appeared to request the girl's
hand for his Sovereign. And again the
parents answered: "She is still too young!"</p>

<p>Both the Kings were very angry at this
refusal, and resolved to revenge themselves
on the poor Princess.</p>

<p>As they were not able themselves to carry
out their wicked resolve, they summoned a
Magician and said to him: "You must
devise for us some charm to be used against
the Princess&mdash;and the worse it is the greater
shall be your reward!"</p>

<p>With the words, "In one month your wish
shall be fulfilled!" the Magician departed.</p>

<p>Before the four weeks were over, he
appeared again in the castle of the King of
Spain.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, here is the charm!" he
cried. "Give her this ring as a present, and
when she has worn it on her finger for
four-and-twenty hours, you shall see the
effect!"</p>

<p>Now the two Kings consulted together as
to how they should get the ring to the
Princess. For they were no longer friendly
with her parents, who would, consequently,
become suspicious of any present sent by
them. What was to be done?</p>

<p>"I have it! I have it!" the King of
Spain cried, suddenly.</p>

<p>Then he disguised himself as a goldsmith,
set out on a journey, and took up his position
just opposite the palace where the Princess
lived. The Queen noticed him from her
window, and as she happened at that time
to be wanting to buy some jewellery she sent
for him. After she had bought from the
stranger various bracelets, chains, and earrings,
she said to her daughter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you will not choose anything among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
all these fine things for yourself, little
daughter?"</p>

<p>Then the Princess answered, "I see
nothing especially beautiful among them."</p>

<p>Then the disguised King took the ring
out of its case, which he had up to the present
kept hidden, made it sparkle in the
sun, and said: "Your Majesty, here is still
a very rare jewel; this ring has not its equal
in the world for beauty.
And it does not please
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid!
Oh, how beautifully it
sparkles and gleams!"
cried the Princess, entranced.
"How much
does it cost?"</p>

<p>"The ring has no
price; I shall be contented
with whatever you
give me for it."</p>

<p>Then a great sum of
money was paid to him,
and he went his way. The
Princess put the ring on
her finger, and could not
turn her eyes away from
it, so charmed was she
with its brilliancy. But
four-and-twenty hours
had not passed&mdash;it was
just evening&mdash;when the
poor girl uttered a terrible
cry of anguish.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear!"
sounded through the
whole palace.</p>

<p>The King, the Queen,
and all the ladies of the
Court ran, white with
terror, and with candles
in their hands, to see
what had happened.</p>

<p>"Take away your candles! Take them
away! Take them away!" cried the
Princess, beside herself with despair. "Do you
not see that I have turned into cotton-wool?"</p>

<p>And her body had, indeed, suddenly
changed into cotton-wool. The King and
Queen were inconsolable at this terrible misfortune,
and they at once summoned the
wisest men of the kingdom to consult with
them as to what was to be done in this
extremity.</p>

<p>"Your Majesties," the councillors concluded,
after long deliberation, "have it proclaimed
in all countries that whoever restores
your daughter may wed her."</p>

<p>And then messengers with drums and
trumpets went round the whole kingdom
and far beyond it, and proclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who restores the Princess to health
may become the King's son-in-law."</p>

<div class="caption"><p>"THE PROCLAMATION."</p></div>
</div>

<p>About this time there lived in a small
town the son of a shoemaker. There was
great want in his father's house, and one
day, when not even a crust of bread remained,
and both would have had to die of
hunger, the son said, "Father, give me your
blessing; I will go out into the world to seek
my fortune."</p>

<p>"May Heaven be gracious to you, my
son!" said the father, and the youth took
his staff and set out on his journey.</p>

<p>He had already left the fields of his native
district far behind him when he met a band
of rough boys, who were making a fearful
uproar and throwing stones at a toad to
kill it.</p>

<p>"What harm has the poor animal done
you? Is it not as much God's creature as
you are? Let it live!" he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
indignantly. But when he saw that the
hard-hearted fellows paid no attention to his
words and did not desist from their intention,
he rushed angrily at them and gave one
a sound box on the ears, and another a
mighty punch in his ribs. The boys
scattered in a tumult, and the toad quickly
used the opportunity to slip into a hole in
the wall.</p>

<p>Then the youth went farther and farther
on his way. Suddenly the sound of trumpets
and the roll of drums came to his ear. And
listen! Is not some proclamation being
made? He listened attentively and distinctly
heard the words: "He who restores
the Princess to health may become the
King's son-in-law!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her?" he asked
a passer-by.</p>

<p>"Don't you know? She has turned into
cotton-wool."</p>

<p>He thanked his informant and continued
his travels. Now, by the time night had
sunk upon the earth, he had come to a great
desert, and he determined to lay himself
down to sleep. But how terrified he was
when, on turning his head to look once again
at the way he had come,
he saw a tall, beautiful
woman standing at his
side.</p>

<p>He was about to spring
quickly away when she
said, "Do not be afraid
of me. I am a Fairy,
and have come to thank
you."</p>

<p>"To thank me? And
what for?" the youth
asked, in confusion.</p>

<p>"You saved my life!
My fate ordains that I
shall be a toad by day
and a fairy by night.
Now, I am at your
service."</p>

<p>"Good Fairy," then
said the youth, "I have
just heard of a Princess
who has turned into
cotton-wool, and whoever
heals her may
become her husband.
Teach me how to restore
her to health. That is
my most ardent wish!"</p>

<p>Then the Fairy said,
"Take this sword in
your hand and walk
straight on until you come to a dense
forest, full of snakes and wild animals.
However, you must not be afraid of
them, but must bravely continue your
journey until you stand in front of the
Magician's palace. As soon as you have
reached it, knock three times at the great
gate...." And she described to him
fully what he was to do.</p>

<p>"If you ever need my help, come to this
place at this same hour, and you will find me
here!" and giving him her white hand in
farewell, she disappeared before the youth
could open his mouth to thank her.</p>

<p>Without pausing to consider, the cobbler's
son set out and went straight on, according
to his instructions. He had already gone a
good way when his path led him into a
dark forest, into the midst of wild animals.
That was awful! They filled the air with
fearful roars, gnashed their teeth bloodthirstily,
and hungrily opened their jaws.
Though the poor youth's heart thumped, he
went straight on, making as if he did
not notice them. At last he reached the
Magician's palace, and knocked three times
at the great gate.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 622px;">

<div class="caption"><p>"THE MAGICIAN, IN A GREAT FURY, RUSHED OUT."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a voice came from the interior of the
castle: "Woe to you, rash stranger, who
have the boldness to come to me! What is
your wish?"</p>

<p>"If you really are the Magician, come out
and fight with me!" cried the youth.</p>

<p>The Magician, in a great fury at this
audacity, rushed out, armed to the teeth, to
accept the challenge. But as soon as he
saw the sword in the youth's hand, he broke
out into pitiable lamentation, and, sinking
trembling on to his knees, cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, woe to me, unfortunate creature that
I am! At least spare my life!"</p>

<p>Then the youth said: "If you will release
the Princess from the spell your life
shall be spared."</p>

<p>Then the Magician
took a ring
out of his pocket
and said: "Take
this ring and put
it on the little
finger of her left
hand and she
shall be well
again."</p>

<p>Not a little rejoiced
at the success
of his journey,
the youth hastened
to the King and
asked, just to
satisfy himself of
the truth of what
he had been told:
"Your Majesty, is
it true that he
who restores the
Princess to health
will be your son-in-law?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 593px;">
<img src="images/image112.jpg" width="593" height="682" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE POOR PRINCESS BURST INTO FLAME."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It is verily
true!" the anxious
King assured him.</p>

<p>"Well then, I am ready to accomplish the
task!"</p>

<p>Then the poor Princess was brought in,
and all the ladies of the Court, as well as
the servants, stood round her to witness the
miracle.</p>

<p>But no sooner had she put the ring on her
little finger than she burst into bright flame
and stood there, uttering heartrending cries.
Everything was plunged into confusion, and
the horrified youth seized the opportunity of
escaping from the scene of the disaster as
fast as his legs would carry him. His one
wish was to get to the Fairy, and he did not
stop running until he had come to the place
where he had seen her the first time.</p>

<p>"Fairy, where are you?" he cried, all in a
tremble.</p>

<p>"I am at your service," was the answer.</p>

<p>Then he told the Fairy of the misfortune
which had happened to him.</p>

<p>"You have allowed yourself to be deceived!
Take this dagger and go again to
the Magician. See that he does not fool
you this time!"</p>

<p>Then she gave him all sorts of good advice
for his dangerous journey and bestowed on
him her blessing. Arrived at the great gate
of the palace, he knocked three times. Then
the Magician cried, as before: "Woe to you,
bold stranger!
What is your
wish?"</p>

<p>"If you are
really the Magician,
you are to
fight with me!"</p>

<p>The Magician,
armed to his teeth,
came rushing out,
in a rage. But
when he saw the
dagger he sank
trembling on his
knees, and begged
piteously: "Oh,
spare my life."</p>

<p>"Good-for-nothing
Magician!"
the youth cried,
angrily; "you
have deceived
me! Now I will
keep you in
chains until
the Princess is
freed from the
spell!"</p>

<p>Then he put
him in chains, stuck the dagger into the
earth, and fastened the chain to it so that
the Magician could not move.</p>

<p>"You are mightier than I! Now I realize
it!" cried the enchained Magician, gnashing
his teeth. "Take the goldsmith's ring
from the Princess's finger, and she will be
released from the spell."</p>

<p>Not until the youth had learnt that the
Princess had escaped with only a few burns
on her hands, owing to the promptness of
the bystanders in extinguishing the flames,
did he summon up enough courage to appear
before the King again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Majesty, I implore your pardon!"
he said. "The treacherous Magician, not I,
was the cause of the disaster. Now I have
completely overcome him, and my remedy
will succeed. I have only to draw the goldsmith's
ring from your daughter's finger
and she will be all right again."</p>

<p>And so it happened. As soon as the ring
was taken off, the Princess at once changed
back to what she had been before. But who
would believe it to be possible? Her tongue,
eyes, and ears were missing; they had been
consumed by the flames! The youth's perplexity
at this new disaster was indescribable.
Again he applied to his guardian Fairy for
help.</p>

<p>"You have let him make a fool of you a
second time!" she said, again giving him
advice, to help him towards the fulfilment
of his wish of becoming the King's son-in-law.</p>

<p>When he came to the Magician he shouted
at him: "You miserable deceiver! Now
my patience is at an end! But eye for eye,
tongue for tongue, ear for ear!"</p>

<p>With these words he seized
the Magician to strangle
him.</p>

<p>But the latter cried, in the
utmost peril of death: "Have
mercy! Have mercy! Let
me live! Go to my sisters,
who live a little farther back
than this."</p>

<p>Then he gave him the necessary
directions so that he might
find the way there without
delay, and also the magic word
which he had to pronounce at
the gate. After some hours he
came to the gate of a palace,
which was in every respect like
that of the Magician. He
knocked, and in answer to the
question, "Who are you, and
what do you want here?" he
answered, "I want the little
gold horn."</p>

<p>"I perceive that my brother
has sent you to me. What
does he want of me?"</p>

<p>"He wants a little piece of
red cloth; he has torn a hole
in his cloak."</p>

<p>"Here's a piece, and now
get you gone from here!" a
woman in the palace cried
angrily, at the same time throwing
into his opened hands a
little piece of red cloth, which she had cut
in the shape of a tongue.</p>

<p>He journeyed on for several hours, and at
last came to the foot of a high mountain. On
a spur of rock was a castle, which looked
exactly like that of the Magician. Then he
knocked at the great gate, and a voice came
from the interior, saying, "Who are you, and
what is your desire?"</p>

<p>"I want the little gold hand."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I perceive that my
brother has sent you. What does he want
from me?"</p>

<p>"He wants two lentil-grains for soup."</p>

<p>"What rubbish! Here, take them and
make yourself scarce!"</p>

<p>Then the owner of the castle threw him
two little lentil-grains, wrapped in a piece of
paper, and noisily closed the window.</p>

<p>At last he came to a wide plain, in the
middle of which a castle exactly like the
Magician's was built. When he knocked he
was asked what he wanted, and answered:
"I want the little gold foot."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 529px;">
<img src="images/image113.jpg" width="529" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"THE OWNER OF THE CASTLE THREW
HIM TWO LITTLE LENTIL-GRAINS."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! my brother has sent you to me!
And what does he wish from me?"</p>

<p>"He wishes you to send him two snails
for his supper."</p>

<p>"Here they are, but now leave me in
peace!" a woman called out, ungraciously,
from the window, at the same time throwing
him the two snails he desired.</p>

<p>Now the youth returned with the things
he had collected to the Magician, and said:
"Here I bring you what you wished for."</p>

<p>Then the Magician gave him all the
necessary instructions as to the use of the
three things. But when the youth turned
his back to go away, the captive cried,
imploringly, "And you are going to leave
me lying here?"</p>

<p>"It would be no more than you deserve.
However, I will release you. But woe
betide you if you have deceived me again."</p>

<p>After the youth had released the Magician
from his chains, he hurried away to appear
before the Princess.</p>

<p>Opening her mouth, he put in it the little
piece of red stuff which he had brought
with him, and she at once had a tongue.</p>

<p>But the first words which came from her
mouth were: "Miserable cobbler! Out of
my sight! Begone!"</p>

<p>The poor youth was motionless with painful
amazement, and said to himself: "This
is once more the work of the faithless
Magician."</p>

<p>But he would not let this bitter ingratitude
prevent him from completing the good work.
Then, taking the two little lentil-grains, he
put them into the blind pupils of the girl's
eyes, and at once she was able to see as
before. But no sooner had she turned her
eyes upon him than she covered her face
with her hands and cried, scornfully, "Oh,
how ugly mankind is! How horribly ugly!"</p>

<p>The poor youth's courage nearly vanished,
and again he said to himself, "The worthless
Magician has done this for me!"</p>

<p>But he would not allow himself to be put
out. Taking the empty snail-shells from his
pocket, he put them very skilfully where the
girl's ears had once been, and behold! the
Princess had back again her sweet little
ears.</p>

<p>Then the youth turned to the King and
said, "Your Majesty, now I am your son-in-law!"</p>

<p>But when the Princess heard these words
she began to weep like a spoilt child, sobbing,
"He called me a witch! He said I was
an old witch!"</p>

<p>That was too much ingratitude for the
poor youth. Without saying a word, he
hurriedly left the castle, to seek out his
Fairy.</p>

<p>"Fairy, where are you?" he cried, still
trembling with anger and vexation.</p>

<p>"I am at your service."</p>

<p>Then he told her how shamefully he had
been treated by the Princess, who was now
restored to health.</p>

<p>The Fairy said, laughing: "You probably
forgot to take the Magician's other ring from
her little finger?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I did not think of that in
my confusion," exclaimed the youth, seizing
his head between his two hands in mingled
terror and shame.</p>

<p>"Now hasten and repair the mistake!"
advised the Fairy.</p>

<p>Sooner than he had thought possible, he
was standing in front of the Princess and
drew the evil ring from her little finger.
Then a lovely smile spread over her beautiful
features, and she thanked him so sweetly
and kindly that he became red with embarrassment.</p>

<p>Then the King said, solemnly: "This is
your husband."</p>

<p>And the youth and the Princess embraced
one another in the sight of all, and a few
days afterwards the wedding was celebrated.</p>

<h2><a name="A_Funeral_at_Sea" id="A_Funeral_at_Sea"><em>A Funeral at Sea.</em></a></h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Life</span> on board one of the large
liners which run from Southampton
or London to the
Cape is almost ideal. After
the first week of the trip, calm
seas and glorious sunshine are
experienced, and on board we are free from
the rush of business life, and can laze away
our time to our heart's content. No letters
to be looked through, no clients or customers
to interview, and no morning paper to read.
If that is not a holiday, what is?</p>

<p>For certain reasons, the first part of the
voyage is not so enjoyable to some as to
others, for the Bay of Biscay has a very bad
name, and although it may be a bugbear
whose growl is often worse than its bite,
nevertheless, it sometimes acts up to its
reputation. However, when Madeira is
past, all thoughts of <i lang="sv">mal de mer</i> are put
aside, everyone begins to take a fresh
interest in the trip, and things in general
begin to "brighten up." Deck chairs are
placed in the shady parts of the deck, and we
recline in comfort and talk scandal (for
scandal is talked even on board), read novels
and smoke.</p>

<p>Soon after "The Canaries" are left behind,
however, a committee is formed, and a
programme of sports
and entertainments
drawn up, to enliven
the remaining fortnight
of the voyage.
There are cricket for
the more energetic,
bull-board, quoits,
sports, concerts,
dances (including a
fancy dress ball), etc.,
in which everyone
takes part, and a
good time is provided
for one and all.</p>

<p>But life at sea, as
on land, is not all
sunshine and happiness,
and I shall ever
remember a certain
lovely hot morning
in December, when
we were still nine or
ten days' sail from
Cape Town, and those of us who cared for
the luxury were having beef-tea and biscuits
in the saloon, when the captain's clerk came
in, and said: "There's to be a funeral this
afternoon at four o'clock."</p>

<p>I can never forget the change that came
over the company. It seemed as though a
thunderbolt had fallen. A few minutes
before we had all been talking of the various
amusements which were to take place during
the day, and no thought, except of pleasure,
had entered our minds.</p>

<p>"Who is dead?" we asked, and were told
that a steerage passenger had died of consumption.</p>

<p>There were no games that day: it seemed
as though the life on board had completely
changed.</p>

</div>

<p>At four o'clock nearly all the passengers
came on deck to attend the funeral. The
ceremony was to take place in the "after-well"
of the vessel, the lower deck being
kept for the officers and men who were to
take part in the service. The "gangway"
was taken down, everything prepared, the
engines slowed down, and the body was
borne out on to the deck by the "bosun"
and three of his men, and placed near the
side of the vessel.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>DURING THE BURIAL SERVICE.</p>

<p><cite>From a Photograph.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>At sea the body is sewn up in a canvas
sack, which is heavily weighted at the foot,
and this is laid on a "coaming" (a part of
one of the hatches), which takes the place
of a bier. The whole is covered with a
Union Jack, which is fastened to the four
corners of the "coaming," so that when
the time comes to commit the body to
the deep the one end of the "coaming"
is raised and the body slips off into the
water, leaving the flag in its place.</p>

<p>The captain and
first officer read the
burial service between
them, the other
officers and men joining
in the responses.</p>

<p>Never have I heard
the service read more
impressively than it
was that December
day, and during parts
of the reading there
were few dry eyes to
be seen amongst the
passengers. The
beautiful words are
impressive at any
time, but at sea their
beauty is magnified
a hundredfold.</p>

<p>A few minutes after
the service had commenced,
at a signal
from the first officer,
the engines were
stopped altogether,
and then there was
absolute stillness and
silence, broken only
by the voice of the
captain and the ripple
of the water as the
ship still moved along
her way.</p>

<p>"We, therefore,
commit her body to
the deep...." and
at these words the
men who had stood
by the "coaming"
on which the body
rested raised it gently
up, there was a dull
splash, and the body
sank to rise no more,
until the great day
when the deep shall
give up her dead.</p>

<p>Everything was done in the most reverent
spirit, and when at the close of the service
the engines were again put full steam ahead,
the "gangway" closed up, and the ordinary
routine of ship-life resumed, I could not help
thinking that there is something very grand
in having the profound sea for a tomb. God
seemed nearer in that solitude than in the
crowded city.</p>

</div>

<p>As I was going down to my cabin a
little later I met one of the officers, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
said, "Not been taking the funeral, have
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, it's your own look-out, and you
have to take the risk yourself."</p>

<p>A little farther down I came across one
of the engineers, and he asked me the same
question. I told him I had taken a few
snap-shots, and he
said, "You have?
I wouldn't have done
it for anything you
could have given me."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you know
that to photograph a
funeral on board ship
is about the most
unlucky thing you
could do? Anyhow,
it's your own risk, so
it does not matter to
me. Still, I would
not take such a risk
myself."</p>

<p>Gradually we got
back again to our
usual life on board, and to our games and
frivolities; and by a few, perhaps, the solemn
act of burying the dead had been forgotten
ere we gained our first view of the beautiful
Table Bay, with the picturesque town and
grand Table Mountain in the background,
but on some of us, I feel sure, it will have a
lasting influence.</p>

<h3>A SAGACIOUS HORSE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<img src="images/image118-1.jpg" width="506" height="475" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The accompanying photo. depicts an incident
which, says the sender, Mr. Herbert S. Sellars, of
25, Hertslet Road, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway,
N., may be witnessed any afternoon at Torton, near
Gosport, Hants. "Tom," the subject of the photo.,
is the property of a dairyman well known in that
district. Whilst going the rounds, certain lady customers
have been in the habit of giving the horse
bread. Preceding his master, and arriving at the
houses of these good friends, he draws his float up on
to the pavement, and then knocks at the door by
raising the knocker with his mouth, and then letting
it drop again. This he continues to do till the door
is opened, when he receives his well-earned reward.</p>

<h3>A GOOD JUMP.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 652px;">
<img src="images/image118-3.jpg" width="652" height="457" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here we have a group of merry-faced schoolgirls
indulging in a jump arm-in-arm together, and
the snap-shot gives us a very vivid idea of the
almost incredible positions assumed by the limbs
and body under such circumstances. The four
girls on the left apparently led off, and seem
to be quite complacently perched in mid-air, but the
trio on the right are decidedly unsteady in their
alignment, whilst the young maid on the extreme
flank is quite distressed in her uncertainty. The
photograph was taken at the ch&acirc;teau of the Marquise
San Carlos, near Paris, by Miss Lilian Noble, of
Slissinghurst Grange, Cranbrook.</p>


<h3>FRUIT AND BLOSSOM
TOGETHER.</h3>

<div class="caption"><p><cite>From a Photo. by R. W. Fisk, Rickmansworth.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>The photograph here reproduced
shows a very unique freak of Nature.
It represents an apple tree that was
growing on October 12th last in Mr.
Blake's garden, the Metropolitan
Station-master at Rickmansworth
(Herts), and its point of interest
lies in the fact that although the
tree is still in full blossom there are
several ripe apples upon it at the
same time. There were several dozen
other similar trees of the same age
in the garden, but this is the only
one that bore blossom and fruit at
the same time. The photograph was
sent in by Mr. R. W. Fisk, of Rickmansworth.</p>

<h3>A GORDON RELIC.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image119-1.jpg" width="700" height="459" alt="" />
</div>

<p>With the Soudan reconquered and Khartoum
itself fast reassuming that civilizing influence amongst
the tribes of the Upper Nile that General Gordon
sacrificed so much to accomplish, added interest has
been taken in Gordon relics of late. The accompanying
photograph represents a book that was
printed for the General in Khartoum, and was
highly treasured by him on account of it being the
first book ever printed there. The relic is now in
the safe keeping of the British Museum, where it is
open to public inspection. The text,
by the way, is in Arabic.</p>


<h3>WHAT WHEAT CAN DO.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/image119-2.jpg" width="404" height="462" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Amongst the curiosities of <span class="smcap">The
Strand</span> a few months ago we gave
an illustration of a section of a board
taken from a wheat trough, worn
by wheat passing over it. Here is a
photograph, sent in by Mr. Byron Harman,
of the Tacoma Grain Company,
Washington, showing a steel-plate, 4ft.
square and &frac12;in. thick, taken from a
large elevator at Tacoma, that has
actually had holes worn through it by
wheat continually falling on it from a
height of 4ft.</p>


<h3>A REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/image119-3.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is well known that experiments with paper and
a pair of scissors are often productive of the most
wonderful results, but the design reproduced in the
accompanying photograph is perhaps one of the most
remarkable obtained under such conditions, and it has
the additional novelty of having been cut out by an old
lady of feeble sight. The original paper design was
sent to us by Mr. M. A. Holmes, of 3, Alma Road,
Canonbury, and the reproduction presented in these
pages is from a photograph of it taken by us.</p>

<h3>AN INGENIOUS EXTINGUISHER</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 499px;">
<img src="images/image120-1.jpg" width="499" height="566" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. D. H. W. Broad, of 18, Beatrice Road, Stroud
Green, N., the sender of this photograph, writes that
it represents a curious piece of old ironwork which
has recently come into his possession. It slips, he
says, on to a candle, the spike in the middle going
into the wax at any place you like to adjust it. The
object is apparently to automatically extinguish the
candle, should the sleeper leave it alight on retiring.
When the wax is burnt away the spike is released,
thus bringing down the extinguisher. The candle
in the photo. is standing in an old brass tinder-box.</p>


<h3>WHAT IS IT?</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/image120-2.jpg" width="313" height="473" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This little snap-shot requires quite an amount of
scrutiny to decipher. It has been sent in by Mr.
Andrew E. Pearson, of 8, Cobden Road, Newington,
Edinburgh, who took it on the Gareloch, at Shandon,
in August last. It represents a sailing yacht travelling
from left to right, and throwing shadows so
remarkably well defined that if the picture be
turned upside down it appears almost the same.
When turned end on&mdash;as it now stands&mdash;it might be
mistaken for a bat or a butterfly, or even a moth.
Being reversed again, curiously enough it still retains
the same likeness.</p>


<h3>GIGANTIC BEETROOTS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/image120-3.jpg" width="507" height="553" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This photograph, sent in by Mr. H. Clifford, of
236, 52nd Street, Brooklyn, New York, shows how
they grow beetroots in California. The largest of the
two roots displayed is over 5ft. in height, as may be
estimated by comparison with the young lady standing
alongside it, and it is estimated that it will tip the
beam at over 200lb. Beetroots of this size are
naturally not quite so tender as the smaller kind one
is accustomed to receive at table; in fact, in order
to slice them it might be necessary to use an axe or
a circular saw. Mr. Boker, who grew these, says
that there need be no fear of any denudation of
our forests, as he can raise a good-sized one underground
in the course of a season.</p>


<h3>A HUMAN VIOLIN.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 610px;">
<img src="images/image120-4.jpg" width="610" height="332" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><cite>From a Photo. by Hellis &amp; Sons.</cite></p></div>
</div>

<p>That music hath charms may undoubtedly be true,
but it is difficult to understand how one could enjoy
the harmony, however dulcet it might be, evolved
from such an instrument as is shown in the above
photograph. It consists of the major portion of a
human skull, over which is stretched a sheet of sheep's
skin for sounding-board; portion of the leg-bone as
key-board, with bits of the small bones of the arms
for keys. This curiosity belongs to Mr. A. I. J.
Harwood, of 87, Park Street, Camden Town,
N.W., and was sent to him as a native product
from Durban, South Africa, on July 5th last, by
Mr. C. Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>


<h3>A SURPRISING EFFECT.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/image121-1.jpg" width="491" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Certainly a very unlooked-for effect is to be found
in the photograph of the lady's face here reproduced,
which has been sent in by Mr. Edward Duxfield, of
Eton House, Basford, Stoke-on-Trent. On holding
the picture upside down another face may be distinctly
traced, whose presence is purely the result of certain
combined shaded effects. The mouth is the same in
both faces. The photo, was taken in the garden
about mid-day.</p>


<h3>A NOVELTY IN CAMERAS.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/image121-2.jpg" width="700" height="412" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The interest attached to the next photograph we
reproduce does not lie in the subject illustrated, but
in the fact that it was taken by a very primitive sort
of camera, made out of an old cigar-box, with a pill-box
pierced at one end by a pin prick instead of a lens,
the lid of the pill-box being retained as the cap. At
the back of the camera was an arrangement for the
reception of the plate, and the whole was enveloped
in cloth. This novel apparatus was made by the
thirteen-year-old son of Mrs. C. L. Taylor, of 40,
Nichols Street, West Bromwich, who forwarded it
for our inspection.</p>


<h3>A TRAIN IN PERSPECTIVE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/image121-3.jpg" width="368" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A very curious study in perspective is afforded by
our next photograph, which was taken by Mr. E.
Ford, of Bridge Place, Bexley, Kent, whilst leaning out
of a railway carriage window in the rear part of a train.
A curve was being rounded just at the moment the
snap-shot was taken, and in the distance the locomotives
may be seen just about to pass over one of the
newly built granite bridges in Cornwall. Owing to the
hilly nature of the country, all the main line trains are
drawn by two engines. Mr. Ford says that they
were travelling at the rate of about thirty miles when
he took the photograph.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
